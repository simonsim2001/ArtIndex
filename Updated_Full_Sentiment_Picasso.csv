Aligning with the objective of Art Macao, this show will contribute to arts and culture in Macau, establishing it further as a World Heritage city. The six artworks in this show are among fifty works, unique and signed, selected by Picasso himself between 1954 and 1957, among his most exemplary works to be interpreted in gemmail (French for 'enamel gem').event.jpgOne Central Macau's Picasso Gemmaux artwork to premiere in MacauThis exhibition is the very first Macau showing of Picasso's artworks in gemmaux to be presented at the Atrium of One Central Macau with free admission from today until 31st October. This showcase offers a rare opportunity to appreciate many of Picasso's most important artworks. As part of Art Macao's theme, ""The Statistics of Fortune"", this show features works that are reminiscent of the technique of stained glass seen in churches in aesthetics, yet they are back lit light boxes engineered by a workshop led by physicist Roger Malherbe-Navarre working on light diffraction in Paris in the mid 1950's. At the time, the technique was extremely innovative. The layering of several panes of carefully assembled glass gave Picasso's artworks the third dimensionality he sought to achieve in paintings. The technology of these backlit light boxes also gives a new life to the colours, as well as preserving them closer to the intention of the artist. Impressed by the gemmistes' masterful assembling and fusing of carefully selected glass, Picasso declared 'A new art is born!'Intimate retrospective into life of renowned artistic geniusThis exhibition features a special curation of six gemmaux artworks, representing many of Picasso's closest and most influential 'studies' of life. Among them are 'Femme assise', an early portrait of Dora Maar, fellow artist and lover who led him to create the masterpiece Guernica, and the very first gemmail work Picasso signed. Another iconic work is the 'Portrait of Marie-Therese Walter', in which Picasso depicts the French model Marie-Therese Walter, who gave birth to his first daughter, and Mere et Enfant, in which Picasso's wife Olga and his first son, Dora Maar, are depicted. The exclusive series also includes a striking self-portrait of the artist himself, executed in an emotionally expressive style. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Picasso's death and the artworks on display are borrowed from private collections.""We hold a deep appreciation for the role of arts in society and have dedicated ourselves to honouring cultural heritage. We envision ONE CENTRAL MACAU to serve as a canvas that connects art with the community. This Picasso exhibition is the latest initiative which aims to educate, engage and inspire the community in Macau, inviting people to revel in the beauty of diverse cultural expressions."" said Jennifer Lam, Director and Head of Marketing and Communications at Hongkong Land.Sherry Wong, Chairperson of the Hongkong Land Art Committee, states, ""Art Macao is the most important cultural and artistic event of Macau organised by the government and, we are enthusiastic in our participation.

"Magic of the minotaurs: Beth Carter's life-size bronze sculptures - half-human, half-animal - offer a glimpse of a dreamlike world.

Her works were displayed at the Mus√©e d'Art Classique in Mougins and the Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Vie, next door to the villa where the artist lived and died. Positioned on the wall behind one of her bronze minotaurs, she saw Picasso's Dying Minotaur. Like Beth, the artist had been fascinated by the mythical creature. But out of all of his thousands of works, it was this etching that meant the world to Beth.""It's a simple line drawing of a dying minotaur and behind him is a wall and there's all these women's faces peeking over the wall. One of the women has her hand reaching toward the minotaur,"" she says.""I always feel like that girl, that's me reaching towards the minotaur. It epitomises almost everything I feel about the minotaur. When I saw Picasso's original etching behind my piece, I wept. It was beyond what I could ever have hoped for.""Beth, 55, has had a postcard of the etching since she was 30, now slightly dog-eared but still cherished. The curators had no idea she had an attachment to the artwork.Beth has a deep, complicated and strangely beautiful connection to the creature. Her first one was made when she was experiencing a period of light after dark; escaping university in Sunderland, where she was miserable, for a placement in Cyprus. It was there, 25 years ago, that she immersed herself in Greek mythology and her first life-size minotaur sculpture was born. She has been making them ever since. They and her other creatures - a human form with antlers in a defensive pose, a contemplative figure in a dunce's hat, a birdman with a makeshift beak and cloth wings - stir up feelings of tenderness, a desire to care for them. Each one, Beth says, has a duality between vulnerability and strength, like the half-man, half-bull of Greek legend who was imprisoned in a labyrinth before being killed, a frightening but defenceless creature left at the mercy of others. She doesn't fight the need to produce such pieces, getting a surge of energy when the 'library' of ideas in her head throws up something she's driven to create at her studio on the outskirts of Bath.Her studio is in a Victorian school house, all high ceilings, wooden floors and big bright windows.""It's got a real soul to it,"" she says. ""It's got a chapel feel because of the light and the windows - it's absolutely heavenly, it really is.""Sometimes she works outside and dog walkers stop to say 'hello', drawn towards the mysterious minotaurs that are being created against the backdrop of blossom and trees full of song birds.""Some dogs really investigate what I'm doing. I like it when dogs react because I think [the minotaur] must have some kind of life for them to respond.""At the Milwyn Art Foundry, near Hampton Court, they metamorphose. Crafted from clay in Beth's studio, they are moulded in silicon, made into a hollow wax, and cast in bronze before patination. It's an ancient process, skilfully executed, 'full of fire and heavy metal', with the bronze poured from a huge crucible.""The stage I see the bronze at first is when it's completely covered in ceramic shell,"" Beth says. ""They chip all that off, so you see the bronze revealed. There he is in metal. The transformation from the soft clay, that's completely vulnerable, into this permanent metal form, is like alchemy. It exists in its own world now.""Many people feel a warmth towards the sculptures even before they understand the significance of Beth's childhood memories and her father's traumatic upbringing.Beth was living in New York when her dad - an artist carving and constructing things from stone and marble in the yard behind their home - died suddenly in 2012. She was working towards a solo show and life was good.""It was the best year of my life and then the worst thing happened,"" she says. ""As a kid I was always the one who was out in his workshop, making stuff in the corner and watching him. I'm probably an artist because he was an artist.""Despite their bond, living with him could be tough. He had bipolar and depression and struggled with anger. His own father had been a violent, alcoholic slaughterman, who regularly beat Beth's dad and his five brothers.Only after Beth had built up a body of work over 10 years did she realise the relationship between the minotaurs and her father.""My dad was a complicated character,"" she says. ""He would never be violent to us but he would smash things up. He was brooding and would withdraw from the family. But when he wasn't like that, he was absolutely wonderful and funloving; he had different sides to his personality.""The minotaur in the myth is very lonely, very isolated, very brooding. He's a sort of monster and people are frightened of him. On a basic level, as a child, that was what was happening to me. As much as I adored my dad, he was frightening. After therapy my dad became much softer and less angry, he mellowed. He was extremely sensitive and intelligent and all these things I hadn't seen as a child.""All of that is encompassed in the minotaur; all of those paradoxes. In the myth, he was born into these circumstances and was a victim of those circumstances, he was locked away in his labyrinth and treated brutally - all of that ties in with my dad's story.""When Beth is sculpting, she often gets close to the emotions she feels about her father's childhood, and her own, but it's never morbid. ""It's being OK with the sadness; it's just part of the spectrum of things we feel,"" she says. ""And, actually, I'm very happy most of the time, even though I've had sad periods in my life. I wish all the stuff hadn't happened. But I feel shaped by it.""It was her desire to give her minotaurs tiny books to read that finally made Beth understand their significance. She realised a memory buried in her mind was coming out in her work, a conversation when her dad told her he had never had a book as a child. ""Your subconscious stores all this stuff,"" she says. It comforts her to hear that her work communicates the love she pours into it; it makes the hairs on her arms stand on end.""For me, it is an absolute revelation that art can do that and I am still gobsmacked by its power,"" she says.One buyer wrote to Beth to say she hadn't wanted to leave her small minotaur behind when she was going away. So she put him in the front seat of her car, put a seatbelt around him, and took him home for Christmas with her parents.Neither Beth, nor anyone who has bonded with her sculptures, would be surprised to hear that. ""I feel really close to [my sculptures]. I know them. I care about them deeply,"" she says.Today, her bronze friends live all over the world. Soon many more of them will take their place in the south of France.After the Picasso exhibition, Beth was invited back to Mougins to be artist in residence for 2026. The Mougins Monumental will see her exhibit between 20 and 30 life-sized pieces - flying figures, minotaurs and more - around the town for a year.""Before I did the speech [at the Mougins exhibition launch] I came across this thing Picasso said, which was, if he drew a line of all the places he had been in his life, it would make the shape of a minotaur.""It struck me like a bolt of lightning. That is what my life feels like. All the good things that have happened to me, all the amazing things I have been able to be a part of, is because of the minotaurs.""¬¶ Visit bethcarter.co.uk or follow @bethcarterartist on Instagram.

"'My sculptures are very alive to me': Beth Carter's life-size bronze sculptures - half-human, half-animal - offer a glimpse of a dreamlike world.

Her works were displayed at the Mus√©e d'Art Classique in Mougins and the Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Vie, next door to the villa where the artist lived and died. Positioned on the wall behind one of her bronze minotaurs, she saw Picasso's Dying Minotaur.Like Beth, the artist had been fascinated by the mythical creature. But out of all of his thousands of works, it was this etching that meant the world to Beth.""It's a simple line drawing of a dying minotaur and behind him is a wall and there's all these women's faces peeking over the wall. One of the women has her hand reaching toward the minotaur,"" she says.""I always feel like that girl, that's me reaching towards the minotaur. It epitomises almost everything I feel about the minotaur. When I sawPicasso's original etching behind my piece, I wept. It was beyond what I could ever have hoped for."""" Beth, 55, has had a postcard of the etching since she was 30, now slightly dog-eared but still cherished.The curators had no idea she had an attachment to the artwork.""It makes you feel there's all these connecting threads; the serendipity of it all,"" she says. ""When I think about it I get shivers."""" Beth has a deep, complicated and strangely beautiful connection to the creature. Herfirst one was made when she was experiencing a period of light after dark; escaping university in Sunderland, where she was miserable, for a placement in Cyprus. It was there, 25 years ago, that she immersed herself in Greek mythology and her first life-size minotaur sculpture was born.She has been making them ever since. They and her other creatures - a human form with antlers in a defensive pose, a contemplative figure in a dunce's hat, a birdman with a makeshift beak and cloth wings - stir up feelings of tenderness, a desire to care for them and keep them safe.Each one, Beth says, has a duality between vulnerability and strength, like the half-man, half-bull of Greek legend who was imprisoned in a labyrinth before being killed, a frightening but defenceless creature left at the mercy of others.She doesn't fight the need to produce such pieces, getting a surge of energy when the 'library' of ideas in her head throws up something she's driven to create at her studio on the outskirts of Bath.After growing up in Calne, Wiltshire, and 25 years living and working in Bristol, Beth and her husband have moved to the countryside, not far from the city. Her studio is in a Victorian school house, all high ceilings, wooden floors and big bright windows.""It's got a real soul to it,"" she says.""It's got a chapel feel because of the light and the windows - it's absolutely heavenly, it really is.""Sometimes she works outside and dog walkers stop to say 'hello', drawn towards the mysterious minotaurs that are being created against the backdrop of blossom and trees full of song birds.""""hey come past and blink and think, 'Oh my god, what is that creature?' Some dogs really investigate what I'm doing. I like it when dogs react because I think [the minotaur] must have some kind of life for them to respond."""" At the Milwyn Art Foundry, near Hampton Court, they metamorphose. Crafted from clay in Beth's studio, they are moulded in silicon, made into a hollow wax, and cast in bronze before patination. It's an ancient process, skilfully executed, 'full off ire and heavy metal', with the bronze poured from a huge crucible.""""he stage I see the bronze at first is when it's completely covered in ceramic shell,"" Beth says. ""They chip all that off, so you see the bronze revealed. There he is in metal. The transformation from the soft clay, that's completely vulnerable, into this permanent metal form, is like alchemy. It exists in its own world now. I've made it and it's gone forth into the world."""" Many people feel a warmth towards the sculptures even before they understand the signficance of Beth's childhood memories and her father's traumatic upbringing.Beth was living in New York when her dad - an artist carving and constructing things from stone and marble in the yard behind their home - died suddenly in 2012. She was working towards a solo show and life was good.""It was the best year of my life and then the worst thing happened,"" she says.""As a kid I was always the one who was out in his workshop, making stuf f in the corner and watching him. I'm probably an artist because he was an artist. I never thought I would do anything else."""" Despite their bond, living with him could be tough. He had bipolar and depression and struggled with anger. His own father had been a violent, alcoholic slaughterman, who regularly beat Beth's dad and hisfive brothers.Only after Beth had built up a body of work over 10 years did she realise the relationship between the minotaurs and her father.""My dad was a complicated character,"" she says. ""He would never be violent to us but he would smash things up. He was brooding and would withdraw from the family. But when he wasn't like that, he was absolutely wonderful and fun-loving; he had different sides to his personality.""""he minotaur in the myth is very lonely, very isolated, very brooding. He's a sort of monster and people are frightened of him. On a basic level, as a child, that was what was happening to me. As much as I adored my dad, he was frightening. After therapy my dad became much softer and less angry, he mellowed. He was extremely sensitive and intelligent and all these things I hadn't seen as a child.""All of that is encompassed in the minotaur; all of those paradoxes. In the myth, he was born into these circumstances and was a victim of those circumstances, he was locked away in his labyrinth and treated brutally - all of that ties in with my dad's story.""When Beth is sculpting, she often gets close to the emotions she feels about her father's childhood, and her own, but it's never morbid.""It's being OK with the sadness; it's just part of the spectrum of things we feel.

Pablo Picasso unmasked as accomplice in the ‚Äòaffaire des statuettes‚Äô,Telegraph.co.uk,17 Feb 2024,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hit New book claims the artist helped in the theft of two Iberian sculptures from the Louvre in 1907 It has all the ingredients for a classic crime thriller: high-value art, a heist at the Louvre and one of the most influential artists in history.For more than a century, intrigue has surrounded Pablo Picasso‚Äôs role in the ‚Äúaffaire des statuettes‚Äù.Now a new book claims that Picasso not only commissioned the theft of two Iberian sculptures from the Louvre, but ‚Äúalmost certainly participated in it‚Äù.Dr Noah Charney, a Pulitzer-nominated professor of art history who specialises in art crime, argues that the sculptures were then not on display in the Louvre but in storage, ‚Äúso they had to be proactively sought out‚Äù.Dr Charney told The Telegraph that each statue, created in the third century BC, weighs more than 15 lbs: ‚ÄúA single person could hardly steal both heads alone, so I argue that both Picasso and Apollinaire were accomplices.‚ÄùA 2021 exhibition in Spain questioned whether Picasso had inspired his friend, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, to steal two ancient Iberian statues from the museum in 1907. Picasso then hid them in his wardrobe.He noted that, at the time of their theft, the statues had no real financial value: ‚ÄúTheir interest was archaeological and related to the history of the pre-Roman inhabitants of what is now Spain and Portugal, the Iberians, a tribe that only recently was coming to scholarly attention. Picasso felt an immediate connection to them, seeing a shared Iberian heritage in them.‚ÄùHe said that Picasso had first seen them in 1904, when they were shown in a new room at the Louvre that featured Iberian art: ‚ÄúAs a proud Spaniard, Picasso was thrilled by the ancient sculptures that had an air of the simplified abstraction of Cycladic figurines and yet were millennia old, and were the original, most authentic art of Picasso‚Äôs homeland. The statues were perhaps not artistic masterpieces. Not perhaps the most obvious choice for something to steal, and yet they would be stolen.‚ÄùThey would prove of central importance to the evolution of modern art, inspiring Picasso‚Äôs interpretation of them in his masterpiece, Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon), begun the year of their theft.Dr Charney is an internationally best-selling author of more than 20 books, including Collector of Lives: Giorgio Vasari and the Invention of Art, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.His latest research features in his new book, The Thefts of the Mona Lisa: The Complete Story of the World‚Äôs Most Famous Artwork, published in February.In a chapter on Picasso and the Iberian statues, he downplays the suspected involvement in this theft of Joseph-Honor√© G√©ry Pieret, a Belgian conman and Apollinaire‚Äôs personal secretary, who later boasted about stealing objects from the Louvre at a time when they were simply laid out on tables, without locks or glass vitrines.He writes that the Louvre‚Äôs Iberian room was tucked out of the way and relatively difficult to find: ‚ÄúAlthough it is a stretch to think that Pieret would randomly happen to choose that room to burgle, it is beyond plausibility that he should happen to steal the very statues that Picasso had so admired‚Ä¶ and then happen to offer them to the Spaniard‚Ä¶‚ÄúWe know that Picasso kept them hidden among his clothes because his lover at the time, Fernande Olivier, had noted in her memoir how she always found it odd that, of all the artworks in Picasso‚Äôs collection, most of which were displayed prominently around his apartment and studio, only these two statue heads remained resident at the bottom of his wardrobe.‚ÄùHe added that, in 1911, Picasso and Apollinaire were brought in for questioning by the Paris police on suspicion of having stolen the Mona Lisa because of Apollinaire‚Äôs connection to Pieret as a known thief: ‚ÄúIn fact, they were innocent of the Mona Lisa theft, but they were terrified nonetheless ‚Äì so much so that Picasso, under oath, denied having ever before seen Apollinaire. [They] were petrified of the police not because they had stolen the Mona Lisa but because they had stolen something else.‚ÄùApollinaire returned the two statue heads anonymously to the Paris newspaper where he worked as an art critic. The police were largely occupied with recovering the Mona Lisa and so Picasso and Apollinaire got away with the Iberian theft.Dr Charney expressed surprise that this case has not received greater attention: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a barely-known fact, but a fact nonetheless. I believe I‚Äôm the first to thoroughly tell the ‚Äòaffaire des statuettes‚Äô in full depth.‚ÄùWord count: 767Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Sotheby's Dubai described the viewing as ""the first time a painting of this calibre by the world-renowned artist has ever been exhibited in the UAE,"" emphasising that it is the first time the portrait has left US soil in half a century.UAE Culture Minister Sheikh Salem bin Khalid al-Qassimi remarked, ""Over the years, the UAE has earned the status of being a global art destination, which receives a further boost as this rare Picasso is unveiled here.""Titled ""Femme a la montre,"" this remarkable painting is scheduled for auction in November as part of a two-day event featuring the prestigious collection of the late New Yorker, Emily Fisher Landau. The portrait's subject, Marie-Therese Walter, crossed paths with Picasso in Paris in 1927, while the artist was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. Walter, who had been just 17 at the time, went on to become not only a significant figure in Picasso's life but also a prominent subject in his art. In 2021, another of Picasso's works featuring Walter, titled ""Femme assise pres d'une fenetre (Marie-Therese),"" was sold at auction by Christie's for a staggering $103.4 million.Pablo Picasso, who passed away 50 years ago in 1973 at the age of 91, remains an enduring and influential figure in the art world. However, in light of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault, his legacy has been marred by accusations of exerting a coercive influence over the women who played pivotal roles in his life and artistry. Despite these controversies, Picasso's work continues to captivate and inspire art enthusiasts worldwide.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Times.Word count: 370Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The 6-year-old couldn‚Äôt remember what, exactly ‚Äì the lesson was a ‚Äúlong time ago‚Äù ‚Äì but he did recall taking ripped pieces of construction paper and putting them together in a collage to mimic the famous artist‚Äôs style. So Wednesday morning, when he saw a Picasso piece in person, he jumped up and offered a one-word review: ‚Äúneat!‚Äù Oliver and his grandpa Keith Kinney, a museum board member, were among the collection of people who streamed into the Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science‚Äôs newly renovated gallery to finally lay eyes on ‚ÄúSeated Woman in Red Hat,‚Äù the glass mosaic that was unveiled to the general public after hiding in storage for more than six decades. The piece had been available to museum members since Sunday, but Wednesday marked the first day anyone could take a look. According to museum executive director Mary Bower, about 300 people have viewed the Picasso in that limited window. And about 40 others attended the ribbon-cutting by Evansville Mayor Stephanie Terry Wednesday morning. Bower believes ‚ÄúSeated Woman‚Äù will raise the museum‚Äôs profile and bring scores of new guests ‚Äì both locally and from around the world. Created through a process called gemmail ‚Äì in which shards of painted glass are bonded together with heated enamel ‚Äì the mosaic is one of only two artworks of its kind publicly on display in the U.S. ‚ÄúToday is a historic day for our museum,‚Äù she said. What the display looks like, and how 'Seated Woman' was created The piece peers from a back wall in the revamped gallery under a recreation of the famed artist‚Äôs signature, which also shines in the artwork‚Äôs upper-right corner. Nearby displays tell the story of Picasso, industrial designer Raymond Loewy, who donated the piece back in 1963, and the ‚ÄúSeated Woman‚Äù herself: Marie-Therese Walter, who started as Picasso‚Äôs 17-year-old muse before becoming his mistress and eventually the mother of his daughter, Maya. The exhibit also includes four Picasso prints housed in the museum‚Äôs permanent collection, as well as more than 20 others on loan from a New York museum until July 21. It‚Äôs encased in its original frame and backlit by strings of LED bulbs, which allows the colors to glimmer and shine. The most interesting views come up close, where you can see how the thick shards bulge and piece together. Although it bears Picasso‚Äôs name, he didn't create it all himself. He was one of several famous artists who worked at Jean Crotti and Roger Malherbe-Navarre‚Äôs Paris studio in the 1950s, allowing glass artisans to recreate previous paintings in the new gemmail technique. The painting version of ""Seated Woman"" actually hangs in the St. Louis Art Museum. Bower likened Picasso‚Äôs role in the mosaic to that of a supervisor. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how hands-on each individual artist was, but they didn‚Äôt just commission it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey were there making artistic decisions ‚Äì just like sculptors at a foundry.‚Äù A 1961 Cincinnati Enquirer article on a traveling gemmail exhibit said ‚Äúexpert craftsmen‚Äù would take painted glass slabs of varying thickness and fit them together while others would stand on stepladders above them, telling their partners where the pieces should go to best filter the light. Picasso ended up making about 50 of them, selling most of them to private collectors, Bower said. That included Loewy ‚Äì the man behind the Lucky Strike log and Greyhound bus design, among several other pieces of 20th century iconography. Cynthia Pate was among the crowd on Wednesday. She taught art at McGary Middle School and Harrison High School for more than 30 years, but said she had never laid eyes on something like ‚ÄúSeated Woman.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done some stained glass myself, but never have I seen that technique,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs luminous in a way that a two-dimensional painting doesn‚Äôt quite achieve. ‚ÄúI was just thinking ‚Äì I certainly would have brought field trips here in my day.‚Äù How Evansville's 'Seated Woman in Red Hat' was discoveredThe discovery of ‚ÄúSeated Woman‚Äù made national headlines in 2012. Bower, then working as the museum‚Äôs curator, got a call from Guernsey‚Äôs Auction house that fall. They had a simple but intriguing question: do you have any works donated by Raymond Loewy? She checked their records and saw they did. But the artist was listed not as Picasso but as ‚ÄúGemmaux‚Äù ‚Äì the plural of gemmail. That‚Äôs when the woman from Guernsey‚Äôs dropped the bomb: the museum unknowingly owned a rare piece bearing Picasso‚Äôs name. Bower said it had sat on a shelf in storage, housed in its original frame and an old lightbox. But since it wasn‚Äôt illuminated, they couldn‚Äôt see what they had. It just looked like a piece of stained glass in a darkened room. They signed a contract with Guernsey‚Äôs to sell it, but no buyer ever offered the reserved price, and the contract expired. ‚ÄúThe board at that time said ‚Äòthis is a unique piece. Our job as a museum is to have a collection and improve the collection,‚Äù‚Äù Bower said. ‚Äú‚ÄòLet‚Äôs keep this.‚Äô‚Äù Problem was, they had no way to display it. They had just come off a $14 million campaign to add the new wing that now houses the planetarium, so money for security and a renovated wing was scarce. Around 2021 they began the work in earnest, and Wednesday was the culmination. But there‚Äôs still work to be done and money to be raised. The planned renovations could expand the art gallery by 34% and create a sculpture space with a panoramic view of the Ohio River, Bower said. And ‚ÄúSeated Woman,‚Äù finally free from storage, will permanently hang alongside that.

Evansville Mayor Stephanie Terry will commemorate the moment with a ribbon-cutting.Media will be barred from the members-only viewings, but will be allowed to see the Picasso an hour before the public unveiling, Walker said. The move comes almost 12 years after the museum sparked national headlines by announcing it had discovered ""Seated Woman"" languishing in storage, where it had apparently been waiting since 1963.Famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy ‚Äì the man behind the Lucky Strike logo and the outside design of Air Force One ‚Äì gifted it to his friend, former Evansville Museum director Siegfried Weng, that year. But instead of labeling it as a Picasso, officials listed the artist as ""Gemmaux,"" a word for the process used to create it.Thinking they had a work by some obscure French artist instead of one of the masters of the 20th century, they tucked it into storage for almost 50 years and didn't discover it until 2012.After an attempt to sell it to a New York auction house failed to materialize, the piece's whereabouts became a mystery and no one outside the museum's inner-circle ever laid eyes on it. But that will change later this month.Did Picasso actually create the piece? The artwork is a recreation of a Picasso painting made through a process called ""gemmail,"" in which fragments of painted glass are bonded together with heated enamel. The piece is then lit from the back, allowing its myriad colors to shine. According to the Corning Museum of Glass, French artist Jean Crotti founded the technique in the 1930s and began working with lighting expert Roger Malherbe-Navarre, who opened a studio in Paris in the 1950s.Scores of artists flocked there, eager to have their works recreated using the new technique. Picasso was one of them.But although ""Seated Woman"" bears his name, it's unclear how hands-on Picasso was in creating it. According to a 1961 article in the Cincinnati Enquirer about a traveling gemmail exhibit, ‚Äúexpert craftsmen‚Äù take painted glass slabs of varying thickness and fit them together while others stand on stepladders above them, telling their partners where the pieces should go to best filter the light. ""The artist himself,"" the articles states, ""does not execute the work.‚Äù Museum trying to raise millions for Picasso piece display According to the release, the unveiling will be a ""preview"" of the piece's permanent home.Last week, the Vanderburgh County Council approved $300,000 in tourism money to cap a $2.5 million museum fundraising effort to renovate the wing where ""Seated Woman"" will hang. That work is part of a two-phase project the museum has said will cost $9.5 million when it's all said and done.Phase two, however, won't begin for several years. The museum initially asked council for $500,000, but some councilors were reportedly ""confused"" by the multiple phases and told museum officials to come back later to ask for the rest of the money.None of that, however, will stop ""Seated Woman"" from finally going on display.

Art collectors are set to bid for this 1932 painting, expected to be sold at around Rs.999 crore ($120 million).The artwork is a portrait of Picasso's secret love, Marie-Therese Walter. It originates from a year often dubbed as Picasso's ""Year of Wonders"". It was a time when he was preparing for a major retrospective in Paris. During this period, at the ripe age of 50, some of Picasso's most remarkable works were born.Simon Shaw from Sotheby's highlights Picasso's deep-rooted passion for watches. It is an aspect of his identity lesser-known to the public.""He was an incredibly stylish man, very interested in his sartorial identity, and a great connoisseur of watches. Even photos of him wearing his watches are prized by watch collectors,"" The Guardian quoted Shaw as saying.The painting's journey began with Emily Fisher Landau. The celebrated art collector acquired it and placed it above her New York mantelpiece. It has been there since 1968. Upon her passing at 102, she left behind an art collection vast enough to stock several museums. Her collection includes around 400 works for the Whitney Museum of American Art.As the art world pays homage to her legacy, Sotheby's will be auctioning off a part of her collection, expected to reel in over Rs.5,110 crore (¬£500 million).

The current balance of Glen Vine's bank account at the 'ONE Swiss Bank' is approximately US$432,203.01 (over RM2 million at today's currency exchange rate).From the 48-page court papers sighted by Malay Mail, the US government said both the Pablo Picasso artwork and the money in the Glen Vine bank account were bought in New York in 2014 with money either unlawfully diverted from 1MDB or which can be traced back to the Malaysian sovereign investment company's funds.The US government said this meant that these assets could be forfeited as they are properties that are related to violations of US laws, including offences relating to money laundering; misappropriation of public funds by or for the benefit of a public official; and the receiving of stolen money and international transportation or receiving of stolen or fraudulently obtained property.The US government said 1MDB subsidiary 1MDB Global Investments Limited (GIL) had taken on debts by issuing a US$3 billion bond in March 2013, and claimed that funds misappropriated from this 1MDB bond sale were used by Loo to buy the Pablo Picasso drawing in 2014.According to the US government, money originating from the US$3 billion bond flowed from 1MDB GIL through several accounts before eventually reaching Loo's personal bank account.The alleged money flows originating from 1MDB GIL included a US$6 million sent in July 2013 to the BSI Bank, Singapore account of Springbrook Global Limited, which the US government said is beneficially owned by Loo.Springbrook was formed in the British Virgin Islands in March 2013 and its bank account was opened in April that same year.According to the US court filing, Loo allegedly transferred US$1.9 million on May 7, 2014 from the Springbrook account to her personal account at BSI Bank in Singapore.The US government said the Christie's Auction House in New York had on May 13, 2014 given Loo an invoice for the Pablo Picasso drawing, with total sales price including tax being US$1,377,268.75.'On or about June 24, 2014, Loo transferred approximately US$1,377,293 from her personal account at BSI Bank in Singapore to an account at Christie's to complete her purchase of the TROIS FEMMES NUES DRAWING,' the US government said in the court papers.Malay Mail's checks of the website for Christie's shows that the 1969 pencil drawing carrying Picasso's signature was sold on May 13, 2014 at a realised price of US$1.265 million.As for the Glen Vine account, the US government said Loo had set up the company Glen Vine Partners Limited in the British Virgin Islands in October 2014 with Loo being the company's sole beneficial owner, and that she had in November 2014 opened a bank account at Falcon Bank in Switzerland for Glen Vine Partners.The US government claimed that Loo had on April 7, 2015 transferred US$1.25 million in misappropriated 1MDB funds - traceable to Deutsche Bank loans borrowed by a 1MDB subsidiary in 2014 - into the Glen Vine account at Falcon Bank.All the funds in the Glen Vine account at Falcon Bank are now in a new account at the Swiss bank which took over Falcon Bank, with the current balance being about US$432,203.01. The bank which acquired Falcon Bank is known as the 'ONE Swiss Bank', and this is the bank where the funds which the US government is seeking to forfeit are located.According to the US court filing, Loo was described as having served as 1MDB's general counsel and executive director of group strategy at least during the years 2012 and 2013, and was a main point of contact between 1MDB and investment bank Goldman Sachs for three bonds issued by 1MDB companies in 2012 and 2013.The US government's forfeiture claim was filed at the US district court for the central district of California, as the acts and omissions giving rise to the forfeiture took place in that district.Among other things, the US government in the court filing said billions of dollars were fraudulently diverted from 1MDB for the personal use and benefit of those involved in the conspiracy to illegally take away and launder about US$4.5 billion of 1MDB's money.The US government said these misappropriated 1MDB money were used for the co-conspirators' benefit and their relatives or associates, including to buy luxury properties in the US and other countries and to buy luxury yachts, pay for gambling expenses at Las Vegas casinos, buy over US$200 million in artwork, buy jewellery, buy lavish gifts for family members and associates, to hire musicians and celebrities to attend parties, and to fund the production of major Hollywood films.'The use of the diverted 1MDB funds for the personal benefit of the co-conspirators and their associates was not consistent with the purposes for which 1MDB raised the funds, and neither 1MDB nor the government of Malaysia realized any returns on these purchases and expenditures,' the US government had said in the court filing regarding the entire 1MDB financial scandal widely linked to individuals such as Malaysian fugitive Low Taek Jho.Loo, who was 1MDB's in-house lawyer, was arrested by Malaysian police in early July after years outside the country to escape the law.Her lawyers saying that her surrender was voluntary and that she would cooperate with 1MDB investigations and help Malaysia recover assets from 1MDB.Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak is currently on trial over RM2.28 billion of misappropriated 1MDB funds alleged to have entered his personal bank accounts from 2011 to 2014 and with hearing set to resume on September 18, with the prosecution saying this week that Loo could potentially be called as a prosecution witness in the trial.Word count: 1039Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

A compelling new BBC documentary aims to understand how one of the world's greatest and most influential painters became a target for campaigners due to his misogyny EXCLUSIVEWHEN he died at the age of 91 in 1973, Pablo Picasso was hailed as far and away the greatest artist of the 20th Century. News reports at the time declared: ""Picasso did things no man had ever done before with brush and canvas.""An astounding shape-shifter whose style moved effortlessly through his Blue and Rose periods to Cubism, Neo-Classicism and the avant-garde, the ground-breaking painter created artworks that transcend time and will be treasured for ever.The Spanish artist was responsible for such masterpieces as Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, The Weeping Woman and Guernica.A true revolutionary, Picasso up-ended the conventions of 20th century painting time and again, repeatedly re-writing the history of art. He utterly transformed the way we see the world. According to fellow artist Julian Schnabel: ""His work will be around till the planet blows up.""His granddaughter Diana Widmaier Picasso sums up the artist - who had an ego the size of Spain: ""He is inventive, fearless, very human, very passionate, sometimes dark and probably thrilled by knowing that today we talk about him so much.""In a career lasting more than 80 years, the creative powerhouse was astonishingly prolific, producing more than 150,000 works of art - enough to fill an aircraft hangar.An artist who lived through two world wars and was a peerless chronicler of love and death, Picasso is also the subject of more books than any other artist - in excess of 4,000 volumes, at the last count. This underscores his reputation as the world's most popular and influential artist. And yet, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Picasso's art is being radically re-assessed. Half a century after his death, the painter is being ""called out"" for the heinous way in which he abused the myriad women in his life.The man who declared ""There are only two kinds of women - goddesses and doormats"" is now being held to account for his appalling sexism.Unsurprisingly, his family have rushed to his defence. They argue that many of the women Picasso was close to went into relationships with him with their eyes open.Much more than caricatured, submissive ""muses"", they had agency. They were brilliant, independent-minded, three-dimensional women. According to the artist's grandson, Olivier Widmaier Picasso: ""My grandfather had love stories with each woman, and no one was forced to do anything. Pablo Picasso is Pablo Picasso. It would be too easy to say all those women were victims. But everyone knew it was not an ordinary world they were entering.""Nevertheless, there is still a great deal stacked against the artist.FOR instance, in 1927 when Picasso was 45 and married to the Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova, he spotted the 17-year-old Marie-Therese Walter by Galeries Lafayette in Paris. Instantly smitten, he invited her out. She went on to become his muse and have his daughter Maya. But almost immediately after his child was born, the painter embarked on an affair with the Surrealist photographer Dora Maar.In other examples of extreme cruelty, Picasso stubbed out a cigarette on the cheek of his then partner Francoise Gilot, and, despite the fire risk, he locked his first love Fernande Olivier in his studio whenever he went out for the day.As the author and psychologist Phillippa Perry, married to British artist Grayson, notes: ""Like he could control paint on a canvas, he wanted to control his world and control other people in it."" In a dark coda, finding life without Picasso exceedingly hard, Walter died by suicide in 1977 and, equally bereft, his final wife Jacqueline Roque shot herself in 1986.Picasso stands accused of gross exploitation and the most reprehensible misogyny. As critic Eliza Goodpasture puts it: ""The lurid radicality of his art rests on a wanton disregard for the humanity of the women he painted and slept with.""""It's Pablo-matic"" - an exhibition currently running at the Brooklyn Museum - adds to this re-evaluation, re-examining his work through the lens of his undoubted sexism. Should Picasso be cancelled or celebrated, then? Is he a monster or a genius? Or both? A compelling new BBC2 documentary, Picasso: The Beauty and The Beast, investigates that very question.Director John O'Rourke weighs up whether we should now simply dismiss Picasso as a horribly outdated misogynist. Stories about the artist's private life have, he admits, ""led to some people questioning whether he should be 'cancelled'"".He continues: ""There are so many opinion pieces and podcasts that ask those questions, but when that is the starting-off point for a discussion on Picasso I find it's not a discussion that goes particularly deep. It's a fallacy to think that by looking at something we are necessarily validating it.""A lot of the accusations surround the fact that when he was 45 years old, he had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That's clearly problematic in this day and age, but he's notCaravaggio. He didn't murder anybody."" It doesn't help to simply write controversial figures out of history, O'Rourke contends, because you need to explore them in order to interrogate them. ""It's difficult because it's such a nuanced thing to pursue, but I don't think he should be cancelled because you need to look at these stories.""The Picasso family have welcomed the ""It's Pablo-matic"" exhibition as an attempt to view the artist from another position. They have not tried to block the curators' access to any of the painter's work.O'Rourke also thinks you need to approach Picasso's work with an open mind. ""If you try to reduce somebody to just one element, you're not going to make much progress in trying to understand who they are and what their art means,"" he says.""Obviously, we have to look at these artworks and his life story from the perspective of where we are today.""We can't just pretend that we're back in Paris in 1907 blithely condoning men locking up women in their studios, even when there's a fire risk. We need to see the whole picture in the round.""But, the director continues: ""If we only look at a story from one narrow standpoint, I don't think we're going to make a huge amount of progress in understanding it and why it's had the impact on our culture that it has had today.""IT IS also important to recall the historical context, the rampantly sexist environment in which the artist was raised. Alice Perman, series director of Picasso: The Beauty and The Beast, asks: ""How can you learn or challenge or question if you're just intent on cancelling an individual? Seen through a contemporary lens, Picasso is pretty abhorrent.""By our own mores today, his treatment of his lovers, his children and his friends was terrible.At times, he delighted in psychological cruelty. His bad behaviour is without question."" However, she concludes: ""What gets lost is our historical perspective sometimes. Picasso was a man of his age and his environment. He was the product of 19th century Andalusia, which was incredibly misogynistic.Womanising and visiting prostitutes were part of the rituals of male culture there. Also his mother completely doted on him and did everything for him. That was the world in which he was exposed to relationships with women.'To degree, feasible line artist.'s output their ""It's only in the last decade, post-#MeToo, that we've been having this conversation. Our view of relationships and equality has shifted dramatically, which is, of course, progress. But the difficulty is that we have a propensity to say that, purely by the standards of 2023, he's a shockingly bad individual and not take into account the historical context. We are trying to understand his art solely through the prism of our contemporary experience.""Ultimately, the film-makers would like us to come to our own judgment about Picasso's work. This reflects the artist's view that his art was not there to spoon-feed people with answers. O'Rourke muses: ""Rather than saying as film-makers 'This is the way you should interpret this', all we're trying to do is relay the facts, provide a showcase for Picasso's art and let the audience at home make up their own mind about how they should see it.""In a world too often dominated by the loudest voices on social media, Picasso has certainly been painted as a very divisive figure. But, for all that, it is possible to retain two ideas in your head simultaneously.Perman observes: ""Picasso has increasingly become a polarising figure. But I think that there's a lot in between the two extremes and that you can hold both of those positions at the same time.""some it's to draw a between an creative and life'O'Rourke adds: ""Sometimes there's an appetite for outrage that people like to fuel by invoking Picasso. But I'm not sure that's representative of how everyone understands and sees him. The Picasso 1932 exhibition at Tate Modern in 2018 was one of the best-attended exhibitions in the 23-year history of that museum. I don't think people went to that purely for the sake of being horrified or offended. The vast majority of people went to see that exhibition because they wanted to connect with great art."" To some degree then, it is feasible to separate an artist's creative output from their life. At some point, the work has to stand on its own two feet. Perman adds: ""In reappraising the works of great artists, post-#MeToo in particular, we try to understand the body of work as well as the frailties of its creator. But too often, there's a tendency to conflate the two.""If there is a conclusion then, perhaps it is that Picasso is the archetypal man of contradictions - he can be a world-class artist and a world-class misogynist at the same time. The Beauty and The Beast can co-exist. As his daughter Paloma puts it: ""You can't just say he's a monster or a genius. He's just a man.""That duality is mirrored in Picasso's work.So many of his paintings feature a motif of two profiles resolving into a single face.Evidently, he was very aware of the duality in us all. Whatever our take on Picasso, it is clear we shouldn't rush to chuck him in the dustbin of history. ""If we cancel Picasso,"" Perman asks, ""oh my goodness, who else do we have to cancel as well?""Maybe we should pause a moment and consider that there may be rather more to Picasso than a hideously sexist dinosaur.

He had begun an affair with Maya's mother, Marie- Th√©r√®se Walter, when he was 45 and she was 17.Maya's birth certificate stated the father was unknown and in her early years she described her father as a house painter.Loving to play with his daughter, Picasso marvelled at her innocence and curiosity about the world. In 14 abstract works he captured her childhood and adolescence.She recalled: ""We would be sitting at the table and suddenly he wanted to immortalise an expression or attitude. He told me 'do not move' and rushed off to find some paper, pencils, a board or a notebook.""He also made dolls for Maya and a doll's house made from matchsticks.Shortly after Paris was liberated in 1944, Maya started painting with her father and would playfully mark his work and ask him to draw certain objects.She later witnessed his eccentric side - Picasso gave her and her mother his nail clippings to stop others getting hold of them and using them to cast spells on him.Maya later became an expert on his style and was able to authenticate thousands of his works for the art world.She is survived by her husband Pierre Widmaier, two sons and a daughter.CREDIT: Written by KAT HOPPS and JAMES MURRAYCAPTION: ARTIST'S MUSE: MayaWord count: 284Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But the doctor revived him by blowing cigar smoke into his nostrils.2The artist's full name was Pablo Diego Jos√© Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Crisp√≠n Crispiniano Mar√≠a de los Remedios de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso. He was named after various saints and relatives.3Picasso's first word was ""piz,"" short for ""l√°piz"" - the Spanish word for pencil. He completed his first painting at the age of nine, which was of a bullfight.4In 1909 Picasso and French artist George Braque co-founded the Cubism art movement, featuring geometric shapes.5It was given that name by art critic Louis Vauxcelles who noted the pair's work was ""full of little cubes"".6In 1911, Picasso was arrested as a suspect in the theft of the Mona Lisa painting from the Louvre in Paris. The thief was a museum employee but the artist had been caught buying stolen Louvre pieces before.7Picasso himself has had more works stolen than any other artist - more than 1,000 have been listed as lost, stolen or disputed. In 2010, 271 of his works were found in Paris.8No surprise - he's one of the world's most bankable artists. His Femme Nue Couch√©e, top, made ¬£59.3million at auction painting, Les Femmes d'Alger, sold for ¬£144m in 2015.9Over his 75-year career Picasso produced almost 147,800 pieces, including 13,500 paintings. He also wrote more than 300 poems.10He had four children with three women - his daughter Paloma, below, is a Tiffany's jewellery designer.11Along with Coco Chanel, Picasso popularised the famous Breton striped shirt and wore one almost every day in his later years. It was originally a French sailors' uniform.12He was an admirer of British PM Winston Churchill's art and thought he was talented enough to be a pro.13Later in life Picasso often carried a gun loaded with blanks to shoot people he found dull - including those who questioned his art's meaning.14In 2003, three paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh and Gaugin worth ¬£4million were stolen from Manchester's Whitworth Art Gallery - and left in a nearby public loo, apparently to expose lax security.15Sir Paul McCartney penned the song Picasso's Last Words inspired by the 91-year-old declaring at a dinner party: ""Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can't drink any more."" He died of a heart attack that night.Picasso is on at the Playground Theatre in west London from Wednesday.CAPTION: ¬¶ SALE: Femme Nue Couch√©e.

Fran√ßoise Gilot: Artist who had a tempestuous relationship with Pablo Picasso but shook off his dominance and developed a style of her own,The Daily Telegraph,08 June 2023,"Full TextTranslateUndo Translation Learn more about TranslateFromSelect language...ArabicChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CzechDanishEnglishFinnishFrenchGerman HebrewIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanPolishPortugueseRussianSpanishSwedishTurkishTo TranslateTranslation in progress... [[missing key: loadingAnimation]]The full text may take 40-120 seconds to translate; larger documents may take longer.CancelOverlayEndTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitFRANCOISE GILOT, the artist who has died aged 101, was for 10 years the lover and muse of Pablo Picasso, and she took some pride in being the only one of the painter's sundry wives and mistresses to have left him of her own accord, rather than being discarded by him.Fran√ßoise Gilot came to regard the association with Picasso as a wearisome burden, insisting that she was much more than simply a chapter in his life, and she established a reputation as a painter in her own right, her work being held in museum collections around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne in Paris.She was just 21 and a struggling artist in 1943 when she met Picasso in a Left Bank restaurant, Le Catalan, where she was dining with her friend and fellow artist Genevi√®ve Aliquot and the film actor Alain Cuny. Picasso, who was 40 years her senior, was with his companion, the photographer Dora Maar; he approached the table carrying a bowl of cherries and entreated Alain Cuny to introduce him to the two young women. When Genevi√®ve Aliquot explained that she and Fran√ßoise were both painters, Picasso replied: ""That's the funniest thing I've heard all day. Girls who look like that can't be painters.""Piqued, Fran√ßoise Gilot invited Picasso to a joint exhibition of her and Aliquot's work. ""I'm a painter too,"" he responded - and invited them to his studio. It was the beginning of a tempestuous relationship that Gilot would later describe as ""a catastrophe I didn't want to avoid"". She would remain with Picasso for a decade, bearing him a son, Claude, and a daughter, Paloma, before finally leaving, tired of his domineering personality and philandering. His last word to her as she departed in a taxi was ""Merde.""Marie Fran√ßoise Gilot was born on November 26 1921 in Neuillysur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, the only child of Emile Gilot, an agronomist and chemical manufacturer, and Madeleine Renoult-Gilot. Encouraged by her mother, a ceramicist, from an early age, Fran√ßoise expressed a desire to be an artist, but she faced resistance from her father, a strict disciplinarian who closely supervised her upbringing, pushing her to excel academically and urging her to study law, first at the University of Rennes and then at the Sorbonne.In June 1940 the German army occupied Paris. Five months later, shortly before her 19th birthday, Fran√ßoise Gilot joined a spontaneous gathering with other students at the Arc de Triomphe to place flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in commemoration of the Armistice of 1918. She avoided arrest, but her involvement was reported to the police.Within days she was notified that her name had been added to a list kept by the Abwehr (German intelligence) of young ""hostages"" - citizens under the age of 21 who, as retribution for any German soldiers killed by the French, would be taken and executed. She had to report each morning to the Kommandantur at the local Neuilly police station, knowing that attempting to flee to the Free Zone in the south would lead to the immediate arrest of her parents.""At that time our lives were not worth three pennies, you know?"" she later told Mick Brown of the Telegraph. ""We knew we could die at any moment. In a sense it's not bad: you count for zero, so to speak, because you are so young. But for myself, I made up my mind that I would always be free in my life, whatever happened.""Fran√ßoise Gilot's father subsequently negotiated to pay a substantial sum to have his daughter's name erased from the hostage list, but it was deemed unsafe for her to pursue her law studies, and so, free to pursue her passion for art, in 1942 she enrolled at the Acad√©mie Ranson, a wellestablished art school on the Left Bank where Bonnard and Vuillard had once taught.After their initial meeting, Picasso courted Fran√ßoise Gilot assiduously over the following months, causing Dora Maar to remark acidly: ""I imagine you need to lean on youth ‚Ä¶ About 15 minutes ought to do it, I would think."" Their relationship took Fran√ßoise Gilot to the heart of Parisian arts and letters.She became friends with Matisse and Cocteau, and took morning walks with Gertrude Stein along the Rue de Buci. On her first meeting with Matisse, the elderly painter annoyed Picasso by immediately declaring his desire to paint Fran√ßoise Gilot. ""Pablo did not like that at all,"" she recalled, ""because he had not yet made a portrait of me himself.""Picasso went on to make several studies of Fran√ßoise Gilot, among them Femme au Collier Jaune (1946), a striking geometric work in which a black mark is conspicuous on Gilot's right cheek; sometimes described as a beauty mark, it was in fact a burn from Picasso stubbing out his cigarette on her face during a heated argument.Their relationship was frequently combustible. In a memoir, Life with Picasso, published in 1964, Fran√ßoise Gilot recounted how things between them were good only so long as they were living separately and she was able to maintain her independence, but they began to deteriorate in the years after they set up home together. After the birth of the children (Claude in 1947 and Paloma in 1949), and with Fran√ßoise Gilot's growing reputation as a painter and designer of costumes and stage sets, Picasso's interest seemed to wane and he became increasingly distant, pursuing affairs with other women.His domineering personality kept a succession of wives and mistresses in his thrall, leading one - Dora Maar - to madness, and two - Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter and Jacqueline Roque - to take their own lives. But Fran√ßoise Gilot demonstrated both a fierce independence and a strong instinct for survival.""Nobody,"" Picasso once told her, ""leaves a man like me!"" To which she replied: ""Wait and see."" In 1953 she left - ""I had finally reached the conclusion that my life with Pablo was like a sickness,"" she said - and the following year married the painter Luc Simon, whom she had first known as an art student.Picasso took his revenge by pressuring her Parisian gallery not to exhibit her work, and emptying the house in Vallauris on the C√¥te d'Azur that Gilot owned and in which they had lived: he took with him the paintings and drawings he had given to her over the years, and even the letters that Matisse had written to her.They would never meet again. But in 1960 she received a letter from Picasso's lawyer, with a proposal that she should divorce Simon and marry Picasso, ""for the sake of the children"". Torn by this turn of events, and wondering whether to leave her husband and accept Picasso's proposal, Fran√ßoise Gilot's mind was finally made up when, a few months later, she opened a newspaper to read that Picasso had married Jacqueline Roque. In 1962 Gilot and Simon divorced.In 1964, and in spite of his attempts to injunct the book, she published Life with Picasso, which gave a candid insight not only into the painter's obsessive dedication to his art, but also his monumental egocentricity, depicting him as cruel and totally self-absorbed, a man who for all his wives, mistresses and camp followers was essentially alone and incapable of love.The book leapt to the top of the bestseller lists, the English-language version selling more than a million copies in hardback. Once asked whether she would describe him as a ""monstre sacr√©"", Gilot replied: ""Monster, yes. Sacred, maybe.""After her divorce from Simon, Gilot travelled for the first time to the United States, where she was building a significant following for her work, and where she was to spend much of her life thereafter. In 1969, on a visit to California, she was introduced to Jonas Salk, the medical researcher and virologist who had developed the polio vaccine.""Almost right away, when he set eyes on me, he wanted to marry me,"" she recalled. ""I thought that was rather extraordinary. In fact, I thought it was ridiculous! You might say about me that I am a better friend than spouse. So if somebody should be married, it should not be me.""In attempting to discourage him - or at least test his resolve - she presented Salk with a list of conditions, stipulating that he would not attempt to stop her travelling as and when she wished, or in any way challenge her independence. ""It was four pages of very tight script of all the things he could not do,"" she remembered. ""He said he found it very convenient that I had written it all down. So what could I do?""They were married for 25 years until Salk's death in 1995. ""And, I must say, he was the perfect husband, the perfect person for me.""While travelling extensively with Salk, Fran√ßoise Gilot concentrated on painting, exhibiting constantly in Europe and America. Though her early work had been strongly influenced by Matisse and Picasso in its line and sensibility, in later years she developed a distinctive, abstract style.Among her other books were two volumes of poetry and, in 1975, The Painter and the Mask, focusing on her development as an artist. In 1990 she published Matisse and Picasso: A Friendship in Art, a study of the relationship between the two painters, and in the same year was appointed a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur.Fran√ßoise Gilot had taken American citizenship in 1980, and after Salk's death she divided her time between Paris and New York, where she lived in an elegant apartment-cum-studio a short walk from Central Park, hung with her own paintings, looked after by a uniformed housekeeper who served florentines and tea on a silver tray. She continued to paint each day and exhibit her work all over the world.She is survived by three children: Claude and Paloma, and a daughter, Aurelia, from her marriage to Luc Simon.Fran√ßoise Gilot, born November 26 1921, died June 6 2023Word count: 1683Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

"'Picasso the Foreigner' Review: An Outsider in Paris; The early years of Pablo Picasso's life in France showed evidence of his genius, but the Parisian authorities saw a potential troublemaker.",Wall Street Journal (Online),17 Mar 2023,"Full TextTranslateUndo Translation Learn more about TranslateFromSelect language...ArabicChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CzechDanishEnglishFinnishFrenchGerman HebrewIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanPolishPortugueseRussianSpanishSwedishTurkishTo TranslateTranslation in progress... [[missing key: loadingAnimation]]The full text may take 40-120 seconds to translate; larger documents may take longer.CancelOverlayEndTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitIn 2015, New York's Museum of Modern Art mounted the first major retrospective of Pablo Picasso's sculpture in a half-century, with over 100 pieces, from stylized ceramic heads to ""found"" metal weldings to wood deconstructions. His genius poured forth in three dimensions, building on breakthroughs in painting and collage. One period stood out for its darkened, austere galleries: the World War II years, when he remained in Paris during the Nazi occupation. The objects here were stripped-down, elemental, toying with minimalist representation during an epoch of maximalist anguish, as in ""Bull's Head,"" which fuses a bicycle seat and handlebars, evoking his perennial theme of the bullfight, and opening a portal onto fear and vulnerability, a striking counterpoint to the self-assured, protean figure Picasso presented to the world. We're used to seeing the great man play offense, not defense.Annie Cohen-Solal probes this sense of vulnerability in her absorbing, astute ""Picasso the Foreigner,"" nimbly translated from the French by Sam Taylor. Ms. Cohen-Solal, whose previous books include a life of Jean-Paul Sartre, recounts the artist's biography chronologically, putting her imprimatur on an exhaustively examined life as she scours archives and the French government's dossiers on Picasso, and making the case that the artist's outsider status in France is vital to the understanding of his work. Throughout seven decades in his adopted country he struggled with the identity of foreigner. In the wake of the Dreyfus affair, which had exposed deep anxieties about who was authentically French, the French government had cracked down on immigrants, anarchists and the demimonde of Montmartre‚ÄîPicasso's people. When he arrived from Barcelona in 1900, a brash, ambitious 19-year-old, he was assigned a quartet of ""informants,"" agents who traced his movements and documented his relationships. Picasso was careful not to attract too much attention; as Ms. Cohen-Solal observes, ""he had already discovered the best way to protect himself: he worked."" 13 Books We Read This Week The rise of consulting firms, the scandal that transformed the Justice Department, remembering Nobel laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe and more.His output was prodigious, his brilliance recognized by diverse allies, among them the German dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, the expatriate collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein, and the poet Apollinaire, who declared that ""more than all the poet . . . this Spaniard bruises us like a brief frost. His meditations undress in silence.""""Picasso the Foreigner"" skips around impatiently, but key sections gel beautifully, such as the author's analysis of the charged symbiosis between Picasso and Georges Braque, whom the French regard as cubism's catalyst, the sun to Picasso's moon. (She blames this judgment on nationalist fervor.) There's gossip, too, about money woes, bad romances and intellectual feuds. The author cites Braque dismissing Gertrude Stein: ""Miss Stein understood nothing of what was happening around her . . . For someone who considers herself to be an authority of her time, it might be said that she has never moved beyond the status of tourist.""Ms. Cohen-Solal positions herself as an investigative journalist, pursuing leads neglected by other writers, but her through-line fades in and out, like a forest path. Her detours into contemporary protests and riffs on civil-rights thinkers such as W.E.B. Du Bois (who visited Paris) occasionally feel contrived, although they offer rich context. She toggles between the 20th and 21st centuries, bringing her chronicle into our present. A 2018 exhibit of his early canvases at the Mus√©e d'Orsay highlighted the marginalized: prostitutes, drinkers and outcasts, alongside ""those nomadic performers . . . his clowns, his carnies, his harlequins, his saltimbanques, the child precariously balancing on a ball, the trained monkey, the tame crow.""And yet Ms. Cohen-Solal's portrait reaches admirably beyond the heroic, flawed √úbermensch of John Richardson's multi-volume (and never-completed) biography. She writes with a Gallic insouciance‚Äîwhiffs of irony, shrugs of the shoulder‚Äîbut her anger flares as she connects Picasso's years in France with the injustices of our own era: ""Doesn't the scandal of the greatest artist of our age, stigmatized and targeted because he was a foreigner, resonate now with the rebirth of our ordinary xenophobias?"" Her rhetorical questions are ornate and overwrought, but segue into broader, sure-footed arguments about the development and impact of his most subversive work.World War I kindled a firestorm of ""Germanophobic hysteria"" (Ms. Cohen-Solal's term) that affected all of Kahnweiler's clients. But American collectors whipped out their wallets, and business boomed. Beginning in 1917 Picasso crafted backdrops for the Ballets Russes, joining forces with composer Erik Satie and choreographer L√©onide Massine and marrying a Russian ballerina, Olga Khokhlova: ""In shades of beige, blue, and white, Picasso drew a Harlequin playing the guitar and a Mercury on violin, dynamic, dancing, floating . . . thus reinventing, as his friend √âtienne [de Beaumont] had suggested, the old alphabet of classical mythology."" Ms. Cohen-Solal finds amid this exuberance evidence of ""a mercurial artist in a distraught state.""Even as Picasso ascended the summit of virtuosity, the French establishment snubbed him. In 1929 the Louvre rejected his now-celebrated ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."" A decade later, only two museums in the entirety of France had acquired Picasso's paintings. The artist carried, perforce, an identity card, as Paris had created a police department expressly designed to monitor foreigners. France between the wars was a ""victorious but wounded country . . . swept by a wave of xenophobia,"" Ms. Cohen-Solal observes. ""At the fringe of French society, Picasso became the archetypal menace because he increasingly represented everything the patriots hated: he was rich, famous, unfathomable, uncontrollable, cosmopolitan.""Then came the German and Italian bombing of a Basque village in 1937, at the behest of Franco; Picasso's fever-dream response in ""Guernica"" elevated his profile globally and triggered fresh problems. ""With the renown he'd gained through Guernica, Picasso had become a reference point, a moral compass, and it was to him that people turned when they wanted to decipher the future,"" Ms. Cohen-Solal writes. Still a suspect, Picasso was kept under surveillance by French authorities. The work that brought him international renown and became a ""standard of resistance to all forms of fascism"" marked him all the more firmly as a troublemaker.Art as crime, literally. His sole application for naturalization, submitted just before the Germans marched into Paris in 1940, fizzled. After the war his influence soared, but he maneuvered warily, dodging the likes of J. Edgar Hoover‚Äîwho worried about Picasso bringing subversion to the U.S.‚Äîwhile flashing Communist credentials. (Ms. Cohen-Solal suggests that Picasso's politics were more fervently antifascist than Communist.) He shifted in the 1960s toward the decorative, buoyed by the subservient devotion of his second wife, Jacqueline Roque, a period dubbed by Richardson ""L'√âpoque Jacqueline.""For the most part, Ms. Cohen-Solal avoids Picasso's tempestuous personal life and his visionary evolution, sticking to professional transactions, dramatic in themselves, and the watchfulness that enveloped him like a fog. ""Picasso the Foreigner"" largely succeeds by following a narrow trail through the artist's monumental career, exposing prejudices embedded in French culture (and ours). Ms. Cohen-Solal captures a facet of Picasso's character long overlooked, never wavering in her admiration for the man and his oeuvre.Mr. Cain is the author of ""This Boy's Faith: Notes From a Southern Baptist Upbringing.""Credit: By Hamilton Cain Word count: 1198Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

He was a towering figure who changed the way we see the world. A playful spirit of fun animates many of his works and some are lyrically beautiful.But, in an interview given late in life, Picasso expressed with blistering self-honesty:‚ÄúWhen I am alone with myself, I haven‚Äôt got the courage to think of myself as an artist in the grand and ancient sense of the word. Giotto and Titian, Rembrandt and Goya were true painters. I am only a public entertainer who has understood his times and has exploited better than he knew the idiocy, the vanity, and the greed of his contemporaries.‚ÄùI suggest there was more method than admitted here. Picasso had worked in parallel with the most brilliant and influential, single-minded theorist in modern art, Marcel Duchamp. At the centre of Duchamp‚Äôs enterprise was a mocking of the classical tradition ‚Äì its technical accomplishments, but even more its metaphysical core. In entering a urinal as a work of art in a New York exhibition in 1917, he set a profane act as equal to portraits of courage, pity and tragedy. Duchamp was laughing at the Old Masters, who had wrestled with the central truths about the human condition and sought to find echoes of transcendence and sublimity.He questioned by what standards anyone can claim in a materialist world that their great art is any more truthful, beautiful, or good than his piece of porcelain plumbing ‚Äì which is at least useful. In effect, Duchamp charges the old order with hypocrisy and superstition. Let us at least be honest. I will show you the truth ‚Äì here in my urinal. Life is excrement, and at least with me you get witty puns and jokes about the futility of it all. Duchamp painted a moustache on the Mona Lisa, to make her look ridiculous.Picasso was Duchamp‚Äôs main accomplice in the artistic demolition of Western high culture, with his playful virtuosity projecting a complete nihilism. A portrait of himself in his 90s served as his last confession ‚Äì a clown skull staring out vacantly at the viewer with hideous frozen dread. Arianna Huffington summed him up: ‚ÄúBeneath bitterness and anger was a love of life, which was trembling always on the edge of horror.‚ÄùPicasso‚Äôs egocentricity was mammoth ‚Äì driven by a tempestuous will to power, and especially over his many women. He lived as a bacchanalian immoralist, obeying only his pleasure, and especially a brand of capricious sadism. His response to the one woman who escaped from him, Francoise Gilot, who died aged 101 in New York on Tuesday, was to burn a lit cigarette into her cheek and ensure that no art dealer handled her pictures. Responding to his claim that one had always to have the courage of the surgeon, or the murderer, she had told him she had contemplated that he was the devil, now she was sure.He was not only mean-spirited, but also a coward. In court he disowned his friend, Apollinaire; he refused to intercede with the Nazis, at no risk to himself, to save the life of an old Jewish friend, Max Jacob; and during the war when a pot exploded, he dived under the table, leaving his wife and daughter unprotected. His rationalisation was the modern nihilistic one, to quote him: ‚ÄúI am against everything.‚ÄùAs a rule, creative works should be judged independently of the character of the creator. But, in Picasso‚Äôs case the two are often inseparable. Representing himself repeatedly in his works, both grandiosely and grotesquely, he may appear as a god out of ancient mythology, a rapacious and hideous half-man, half-bull, a monkey, or even a minotaur‚Äôs skull. His nihilism had satanic vitality, as displayed in ruthlessly repulsive images of himself.His Weeping Woman portraits, one of which is displayed in Melbourne‚Äôs National Gallery of Victoria, show the darker reality of his character. The subject is Dora Maar, one of his mistresses whom Picasso often beat, and into unconsciousness. He felt compelled to destroy the very things in Dora that he admired. In the end she lost her mind. The portraits are flat in feeling, apart from a horror that lurks in the fractured faces. The abstracting of the subject kills off any normal projection of female grief or sadness, a repressive distortion that may indicate the painter‚Äôs own guilt, his need to blur the reality of why the woman is at her wits‚Äô end with despair.What comes through in Dora‚Äôs mad eyes is Picasso‚Äôs own terror at the emptiness of existence.Picasso had already introduced a similar one-dimensional mood of blank misery in his colossally influential, revolutionary painting of 1907, Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon. He wanted to call it The Avignon Brothel, for it began as an allegory of venereal disease. Five naked, cubist distorted women display themselves to the viewer, a trio of them mimicking the three muses, but with faces stripped of emotion apart from a frozen look of inner dread, as if they have just seen the Grim Reaper approaching. They might be characters out of Joseph Conrad‚Äôs Heart of Darkness mouthing the climax words: ‚ÄúThe horror. The horror!‚Äù There is nothing feminine or coquettish about these three prostitutes, with their flesh voided of any sensuality. The other two women, with faces showing the influence of African masks on Picasso, look more like tortured, paralysed animals.Robert Hughes suggested that this painting announced one of the recurring sub-themes of Picasso‚Äôs art, a holy terror of women. And an anxiety about impotence and castration, never put more plainly by any painter than in the violent dislocation of forms in Demoiselles.Nevertheless, there is acknowledgment in this work of the high tradition of Western painting, with quotations from Goya, Ingres, and Manet. Picasso may have been the most influential 20th-century voice of nihilism, but, notwithstanding, he was a serious artist, labouring tirelessly on technique and content.Picasso‚Äôs best-known work is the huge painting Guernica, from 1937, representing the suffering experienced in a Basque city flattened by German bombing during the Spanish Civil War. Measuring 4m by 8m, it stands as the last powerful war picture in the Western tradition. Cubist again in style, its imagery is two-dimensional, painted in black, white, and grey. The deformation of the figures gives them the mannered look of cartoon caricatures, as if they are affecting theatre poses, thereby flattening the emotional range of suffering, making it look staged. More weeping women appear ‚Äì Guernica comes from the same period. Also recurring here is the weird repression and distortion of feeling, one that makes the humans look like mannequin dolls. And, the dominant and most striking central figure in the painting is a horse, its head writhing, as if screaming in terror ‚Äì maybe a disfigured, unconscious self-portrait.Guernica has none of the deep tragic gravity of its French 19th-century predecessor, Delacroix‚Äôs Massacre at Chios, which Picasso would have known in the Louvre. Indeed, Picasso‚Äôs confession to not being an artist in the grand and ancient sense is well illustrated in the contrast between these two war pictures. His own projects some of the tone of being the creation of the public entertainer he feared he had become.Picasso is reminiscent of Karl Marx, in his demonic character and mission of destruction. He is also reminiscent of fellow Spanish painter Diego Velazquez who, in his masterpiece, Las Meninas, included a huge self-portrait as the arrogant, value-creating artist. Picasso was obsessed by Las Meninas, painting his own versions again and again, trying both to prove his superiority and to blot out, Duchamp-like, any deeper truth in the original. Las Meninas, whatever the conceit of its creator, is a profound meditation on the role of art in relation to authority and power; it is a touching portrait of the Spanish royal family, and it is much more. The difference between the case of the 20th-century genius and one of the truly great Old Masters, Velazquez, to quote critic John Berger, was that Picasso ‚Äúwas condemned to paint with nothing to say‚Äù.In the end, it may have been a curse for Picasso to be born with such talent, and such a drive to paint. Apart from his early ‚Äúblue period‚Äù works that show some empathy for the afflicted, and apart from moments of childlike gaiety, his vision was of disintegration. Cubism, the style he invented with Georges Braque, was, behind the playful surface, an obsessive pulling things to pieces. Henri Matisse said it all: ‚ÄúPicasso shatters forms; I am their servant.‚Äù At the time of the Weeping Women, he painted a Crucifixion in which Mary, the mother, drinks her son‚Äôs blood, and Magdalene clutches his genitals.Today, we are left with the dismal inheritance. On the one hand, there is the widespread belief held in the cultural elites that nothing exists of any fundamental value ‚Äì leaving the purpose of art being merely to shock, or to wallow in discontent, that is, either painting a moustache on Mona Lisa or quoting TS Eliot‚Äôs Wasteland.On the other hand, the cities of the Western world spend extravagantly, proud in their self-importance, on galleries of contemporary art, or grand extensions such as recently opened at the Art Gallery of NSW. They then fill them with millions of poor imitations of Duchamp and Picasso, derivatives which, lacking any of the wit, the vitality, or the technical accomplishment of the originals, just echo the ugly banality, or as Picasso put it bitterly ‚Äì the idiocy, vanity and greed of the times.John Carroll recently published The Saviour Syndrome, Searching for Hope and Meaning in an Age of Unbelief.Word count: 1616Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

It also offers the most impressive setting, in Hotel Sale, one of the grandest Parisian 17th-century townhouses. To mark the anniversary, the museum has commissioned a radical new presentation of its key masterpieces by British designer Paul Smith. Interwoven with work by contemporary artists such as Mickalene Thomas and Cheri Samba, the paintings are hung against strong colours and dramatic patterns (until August 6).Also in Paris:Centre Pompidou is planning an exhibition including more than 2000 of Picasso‚Äôs drawings; from October 18-January 22, 2024.ANTIBESMusee PicassoSet in Chateau Grimaldi, almost directly on the Mediterranean Sea, Musee Picasso Antibes is surely the most picturesque of the Picasso museums. He used the medieval chateau as a studio in 1946 and, for a few idyllic weeks, he and his lover Francoise Gilot spent long days on the beaches, working mainly in the evenings. In a bout of frenzied creativity, Picasso produced a new work almost every night ‚Äì 23 paintings and 44 drawings in all ‚Äì which represent some of his most hedonistic and untroubled work. He donated all the paintings he‚Äôd done here to the chateau, on condition they remained on display. To get a sense of the vigour of his work in this period, look out for Joie de Vivre, which perhaps best captures the mood, as a naked model dances to pan pipes played by a faun while a boat bobs on the horizon. The keynote exhibition this year focuses on his late work, however: Picasso 1969-72: The End of the Beginning (to July 2).BARCELONAMuseu PicassoPicasso lived in Barcelona from the age of 14 to 24 and, although he moved to Paris in 1904, the Catalan capital was always close to his heart. The main focus of Museu Picasso, founded on a donation of 574 works by his secretary Jaume Sabartes, is on his early paintings. In 1970, Picasso left further bequests to the museum, and the total count is now more than 3000. Highlights include his first major paintings, The First Communion (1896) and Science and Charity (1897). This year‚Äôs exhibition Miro-Picasso, is being held in conjunction with Fundacio Joan Miro (October 19-February 25, 2024).MADRIDMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina SofiaFocusing on modern and contemporary Spanish art, this Madrid landmark is home to Picasso‚Äôs biggest and most famous painting, Guernica, along with dozens of studies and drawings. Guernica, which pays homage to the victims of the bombing of the Basque town in 1937, is a totemic reminder of Spain‚Äôs suffering during the civil war and the Franco regime. This year‚Äôs anniversary exhibition supplements the Guernica collection and focuses on a year of his life ‚Äì Picasso 1906: The Great Transformation (November 14-March 4, 2024).Also in Madrid: There are major exhibitions at the city‚Äôs two most important museums. ‚ÄúPicasso ‚Äì El Greco‚Äù at the Prado surveys the influence of an old master on a modernist (June 13-September 17) and ‚ÄúPicasso. The Sacred and the Profane‚Äù at Museo Thyssen focuses on his classical works and those with a religious theme (September 4-January 14, 2024).MALAGAMuseo PicassoThe main collection of works in Picasso‚Äôs birthplace city is at Museo Picasso Malaga, which opened in 2003 in the Buenavista Palace. The core of the collection is made up of 233 works donated by Christine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso (his daughter-in-law and grandson) and there are presently 162 works on loan to the museum. Best represented are paintings from his Cubist phase, the Classical paintings of the 1920s, and some of his last paintings from the early 1970s. Highlights include a remarkable portrait of his younger sister, Lola, made in 1894 when he was just 13. An exhibition of his sculpture ‚ÄúPicasso: Matter and Body‚Äù runs for a month (August 8-September 10) and then transfers to the Guggenheim Bilbao (September 23-January 14, 2024).LUCERNEMuseum Sammlung RosengartSwiss art dealer Siegfried Rosengart (1894-1985) was a friend of many leading 20th-century artists, including Matisse, Klee and Picasso. He and his daughter Angela amassed the Rosengart collection, which they donated to their hometown of Lucerne. Included are 32 paintings of the highest quality and 100 drawings, watercolours and graphic and sculptural works by Picasso, including five portraits of Angela, who is now in her 90s. The museum is housed in a former bank building, and works from all periods of Picasso‚Äôs life are represented, with the later paintings a particular strength. Aside from the studies of Angela, among the highlights are the many portraits of Picasso‚Äôs wife, Jacqueline Roque; Dejeuner sur L‚Äôherbe (after Manet), Portrait of a Painter (after El Greco); and the Man with Pipe series from the late 1960s.COLOGNEMuseum LudwigThis repository charts many key movements of the 20th century, from the Russian avant-garde to pop art. But pride of place goes to a huge holding of some 864 works by Picasso, which is the third-largest collection of his works after the Picasso museums in Paris and Barcelona. All the key phases of his paintings are represented, and there‚Äôs a sizeable collection of drawings and graphics, ceramics and sculptures, including the plaster Woman with Pram (1950) and the monumental head of his lover of the 1930s and ‚Äô40s, Dora Maar. Other key works include Harlequin (1923) and Woman with Artichoke (1941). Museum Ludwig is further supporting the Picasso anniversary year by making some of its collection available on loan and presenting Suite 156, a dedication to Picasso‚Äôs series of engravings in 1968, supplemented by historical documents. Suite 156 (Octo¬≠ber 28-February 4, 2024).NEW YORKTake your pick from three major exhibitions in the Big Apple. The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) is drilling deep and concentrating on the artist‚Äôs output during just three months in 1921 with Picasso in Fontainebleau (October 1-February 2, 2024). The Guggenheim focuses on his early career in its Young Picasso in Paris show (May 12-August 7), while the Brooklyn Museum will examine some of the difficult questions around his depiction of women in its exhibition titled It‚Äôs Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby. The Australian comedian has assisted with the curation of the showing, which is described as reckoning with ‚Äúcomplex questions around misogyny, creativity, the art-historical canon, and genius‚Äù. Included are selections by 20th and 21st-century female artists such as Cecily Brown, Renee Cox, Kathe Kollwitz, Dindga McCannon, Ana Mendieta, Marilyn Minter, Kiki Smith, May Stevens, and Mickalene Thomas; (June 2-September 24).TELEGRAPH MEDIA GROUPMORE TO THE STORYCasa Natal Picasso, the artist‚Äôs birthplace museum, is on Plaza de la Merced in the historic centre of Malaga on the Costa del Sol, Andalucia, in Spain‚Äôs southeast. The dedicated museum is close to the city‚Äôs major attractions, such as Malaga Cathedral, the monumental 14th-century Gibralfaro Castle and the Archaeological Museum, housed in the palatial Alcazaba fortifications. The Picasso family rented the building‚Äôs first floor rooms from 1880-1883 and later moved nearby before settling in Galicia in the 1890s. The Picasso Foundation acquired the building in 1998 as its headquarters and repository of works by Picasso and his father, art teacher Jose Ruiz Blasco. Permanent and rotating showings in the foundation‚Äôs exhibition salon across the city square feature graphic works from the likes of Catalan artist Jean Miro, while the core attractions in the house proper are the more personal items from Picasso‚Äôs early life, including a recreation of the family library, domestic items, photos and the christening robe of the future master. The third floor is dedicated to an archive of material on the artist and his work. Open seven days; entry ‚Ç¨3 ($4.90). Guided tours are available, which can be combined with Museo Picasso Malaga, just minutes away; about ‚Ç¨25. For historic lodgings nearby, consider Palacio Solecio, a Small Luxury Hotels of the World member, housed in a former 18th-century palace.SUSAN KUROSAWAWord count: 1312Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

According to some sources, Pablo Picasso, Spanish painter and sculptor, created some 50,000 works, amounting to around two per day throughout the course of his adult life. That's including paintings, prints, book illustrations, ceramics and more.No other artist of his generation was so productive, even into old age. Picasso worked up until the day he died at age 91.How old was Pablo Picasso when he painted his very first picture?His first known painting was an oil painting: ""El picador amarillo"" (The Yellow Bullfighter) or ""El pequeno picador"" (The Little Bullfighter), inspired by a visit to a bullfight. At that time Pablo Ruiz Picasso was only nine years old. He came from an art-loving family and his father was also a painter.Picasso was born on October 25, 1881 in Malaga, Spain, a city with a centuries-old art tradition. His father taught at an art school. There were painting materials everywhere at home. His father recognized the ""child prodigy"" in him and honed his academic drawing early on.(Also Read | Renowned Indian artists showcase their creations at 'QALA Ka Qila' exhibition)Did Pablo Picasso train as an artist?In 1892, the talented Pablo was accepted at the Malaga School of Art. In addition to normal school lessons, young Pablo used every free minute to paint and draw and quickly qualified for higher education.After high school, he transferred to the art academy in Barcelona, and shortly thereafter to the renowned San Fernando Academy in Madrid. But the young painter did not like the teaching methods. After only half a year, he left the institute, and from then on was self-taught.He quenched his thirst for knowledge in museums, salons and studios, studied the techniques of other artists and absorbed everything that arose around him in the form of new art, literature and music.How did he become known by the mononym 'Picasso?'In the beginning, Pablo Ruiz Picasso (Picasso is his mother's maiden name) still signed his full name on paintings. From 1900 he began signing his paintings just with the word ""Picasso."" At that time he was still living and working in Barcelona. It was not until 1904 that he moved into a studio in Paris.Later, his last name became synonymous with great art and his gestural, daring painting and drawing technique. In the beginning, his paintings were still strongly colored and almost garish. The talented young Spaniard wanted to attract attention at any price. Picasso's large ego drove him to tremendous productivity.What was Picasso's full family name?Picasso came from a middle-class family. With his two younger sisters, Pablo grew up in an educated environment. It was a tradition in the family to give the children many illustrious names. Picasso's full name was: Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios Crispiano de la Santisima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso.What are Picasso's most famous works?With the ""Demoiselles d'Avignon"" Picasso created the first cubist painting - an abstract art style - and revolutionized art history. The unclothed women he depicted are no longer seen from just one perspective, but from several angles at once.Picasso also made his mark in his second masterpiece, dated 1937. Shortly after the attack by the Nazi Condor Legion on the small village of Guernica (Gernika in Basque) in the Basque Country, he dedicated the gigantic canvas for the World's Fair in Paris to the victims of the attack. The anti-war painting is a protest against totalitarianism. Picasso did not want it to return to Spain until the end of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who seized power in 1939 until his death in 1975. Today it is back in Spain, exhibited in the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid.When did Picasso start earning money with his art?Through the works of what is now known as his ""Blue Period"" and the subsequent ""Pink Period,"" which lasted until 1904, Picasso became increasingly well-known as a painter in Paris. In 1906 he made the acquaintance of Henri Matisse, the most important French artist at the time, who provided him with numerous contacts.Through him, Picasso also met Ambroise Vollard, who bought all the paintings of his ""Pink Period"" from him and made him financially secure for the first time. Later, the German art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, himself a celebrity in the art world, made some purchases, helping Picasso become one of the most expensive artists of the 20th century.Kahnweiler also arranged the sale of one of Picasso's key works - the large painting ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."" In addition to Picasso, the enterprising German-French gallery owner also signed up the painters George Braque, Juan Gris and Ferdinand Leger, but in return forbade all of them to participate in the Paris salons and official exhibitions. As a result of his new found wealth, Picasso could finally afford a new apartment and extensive travel.How much is the most valuable painting by Picasso worth?In 2015 in New York, ""Les Femmes d'Alger"" (The Women of Algiers) fetched $179.4 million (‚Ç¨164.7 million), making it a record fee for any painting by Picasso.The large painting is the final one in a series painted between 1954 and 1955 was sold at Christie's auction house.The entire series was bought in 1956 by Victor and Sally Ganz from the Galerie Louise Leiris in Paris for $212,500 (around $2 million in today's money).How old was Picasso when he painted his last picture?Though Picasso's last well known self-portrait was completed a little less than a year before his death, he actually worked up until the day he died, aged 91, on April 8, 1973, in his villa Notre-Dame-de Vie on the Cote d'Azur.In the last active years of his life as a painter, Picasso devoted himself increasingly to delicate, small-scale still lifes and the interior of his penultimate domicile, the ""Villa La Californie"" in southern France.There he lived in seclusion with his second wife Jacqueline, who largely shielded him from the outside world and his other children, and their daughter Catherine. He had long since distanced himself from the bustling art scene in Paris and the centers of the international art world, where he was being celebrated as the ""genius of the century.""What did Picasso bequeath to his heirs and to posterity?The artist was survived by four children from three different women and eight grandchildren.Soon after Picasso's death, a bitter legal dispute broke out between the heirs. The family relationships were complicated. Picasso was officially married twice.His children from his relationship with Francoise Gilot - the photographer Claude Picasso and the designer Paloma Picasso - as well as his grandchildren from his legitimate son - Paulo Picasso (1921-1975) - fought bitterly over their share of the vast inheritance.In 1976, the material assets left behind by Picasso were estimated at 3.75 billion French Francs (about ‚Ç¨696 million, $757 million). This included houses, real estate, studios, various properties and Picasso's own private art collection with valuable paintings by artists he befriended or greatly admired, such as Matisse, Miro, Modigliani, Cezanne and Van Gogh.The artistic estate of the famous Spanish painter was estimated at a value of 1.275 billion francs. It included: 1,885 paintings, 7,089 drawings, 19,134 graphics, 3,222 ceramic works, 1,228 sculptures and objects, as well as 175 sketchbooks with about 7,000 drawings, which Picasso often made as preliminary sketches for larger works.His paintings, drawings and sculptures became the foundation of the Picasso Museum in Paris, which opened in 1985 - where to this day tourists from all over the globe come to marvel at his works of art.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.Word count: 1276Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

In fact, most of his relationships with women - 11 are known - followed just that pattern: First he would idolize them, then he would treat them like scum. Two of them, Marie-Therese Walter and Jacqueline Roque, committed suicide after Picasso's death.This controversial aspect of the legacy of the superstar of 20th century art is increasingly in the spotlight: ""I would accuse Picasso of being manipulative, of having a sadistic tendency and of deriving a certain pleasure from torturing women in a certain way by making promises and vows of love to them, even if he didn't mean it,"" says Ann-Katrin Hahn, curator at the Picasso Museum in the German city of M√ºnster.Women in particular often ask her how a museum can still celebrate such an artist as an idol, without criticism, she says.Picasso: No scruples, and hungry for powerPicasso, who was born in Spain in 1881 and died aged 91 in 1973 in France, was an unscrupulous genius willing to walk over dead bodies for his career, some of his ex-lovers wrote in their memoirs. He had an almost manic way of immortalizing every one of his affairs in his paintings, drawings, sculptures or ceramics. As enthusiastic as he was at the outset, that would cool just as quickly. Attraction and repulsion almost always followed the same pattern.Fernande Olivier was the first lover to make public the story of her relationship with Picasso in her 1933 book, ""Picasso and his Friends."" She recounts the years spent together in Paris from 1905-1913. When Picasso and Fernande met, he was an unknown, poor Spanish artist with a strong accent.Olivier was one of his most important models during the early years of his career. He broke down her image into geometric splinters; nose, eyes and cheeks are hardly recognizable as such in his cubist artworks. Picasso depicted the view from the front and back at the same time.'Demoiselles d'Avignon': An expression of misogynyUsing Fernande's likeness, Picasso created milestones in the history of modern art.In real life, he treated her poorly, and even locked her up in their shared studio apartment to prevent her from modeling for other artists. She faced poverty when he left her for his new lover, Eva Gouel.Rose-Maria Gropp researched Picasso's mistresses' private diaries and unpublished sources for her 2023 book, ""Goddesses and Doormats. The Women and Picasso.""The art journalist sees the iconic painting ""Demoiselles d'Avignon,"" a major work from Picasso's Cubist phase, as an expression of his contempt for women.""After all, it's simply inconceivable to think of a painting as catastrophic as the 1907 ""Demoiselles d'Avignon"" without aggression on the part of its creator - that's impossible,"" she told DW, adding that it was just as interesting to see how the five penned-in women in the life-size painting mirrored that destructive energy. Picasso was aware of the power of women, she argues.Topple Picasso from his pedestalPicasso despised women, says Abigail Solomon-Godeau, a Paris-based US art scholar. From a feminist point of view, people should distance themselves from this kind of artist, she says, adding that it is time for a new perspective on Picasso.""What I'm interested in is discourses of art history, discourses about Picasso, discourses about great genius, about masters, because it's the discourse that is open to interpretation for a painting,"" she told DW. ""Our perception of the painting 'Demoiselles D'Avignon' is not the same as in 1907. We look with different eyes now."" She adds that nowadays, questions arose that ""could not be asked of the work 115 years ago.""Solomon-Godeau would like to knock Picasso right off his pedestal. He was not superhuman, she says, and people shouldn't excuse his toxic masculinity by pointing out his Mediterranean character.After an initial grace period in the wake of his split from his first wife Olga Khokhlova, with whom he lived from 1917 to 1935, he distorted her image in his paintings into monstrosities. One painting shows Olga asleep on an armchair - a grotesquely deformed figure with a wide-open snout-like mouth.Women in competitionFrancoise Gilot, the mother of Picasso's children Paloma and Claude, wrote about the years 1943 to 1954 in her book ""My Life with Picasso.""While Fernande was penniless after the separation, Gilot was financially independent, coming from a well-to-do family. She saw Picasso for what he was and did not mince words: ""He always put people around him in competition, one woman against another, one art dealer against another, one friend against another. He was masterful at using one person as a red cloth and the other as a bull. While the bull went for the red cloth, Pablo was able to deliver painful blows,"" she wrote.Gilot left PicassoShe was the only woman to leave Picasso, and he never forgave her for it. For a long time he even refused to acknowledge the paternity of their children.Wherever he could, Picasso humiliated his wives, including in his art.Dora Maar, who was one of his romantic partners, was considered psychologically unstable and suffered particularly from the artist's hurtful words. She will probably be remembered forever as the ""weeping woman,"" as it is how he depicted her in his paintings.Attraction and aversion: Picasso's relationships with his lovers almost always followed that pattern, says M√ºnster Picasso Museum director Markus M√ºller. He and Marilyn McCully published the 2022 book ""Picasso. Women of his Life. A Homage.""""Picasso's daughter Maya once told me that Picasso left his wives like someone who goes out one more time in the evening to get cigarettes at the bistro.""His contempt for women was also an expression of the times - and Picasso was not the only one. His friends Apollinaire and Paul Eluard were also erotomaniacs obsessed with sex, M√ºller says. Picasso's wives were usually younger than 30 at the time they met him, sometimes not even of age.Picasso, a macho obsessed with success, has been a much-discussed topic in the art world since the #MeToo movement emerged. Today, people would probably describe him as a prime example of toxic masculinity.Source: DW - Deutsche Welle Word count: 1016Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Picasso, in turn, produced thousands of paintings and drawings of his young muse, often depicting her in cool blues and olive greens.During the 10-year relationship Picasso was emotionally and physically abusive. When Gilot once enjoyed a seaside trip without him, he afterwards held a lit cigarette to her right cheek, later painting the scar in his 1946 portrait of her, Femme au collier jaune. By way of apology he introduced her to one of her greatest inspirations, Matisse.In the late 1940s Gilot became restless and Picasso persuaded her that a child would settle her down. In 1947 she gave birth to a son, Claude, followed two years later by a daughter, Paloma, but she hated being pregnant and Picasso complained that their lives had become too staid.By the early 1950s his capricious moods and casual cruelty had become unbearable and he had taken other lovers. When, in September 1953, Gilot decided to leave him, Picasso set about alienating her from Paris's art world and tried to persuade dealers not to buy her work.""You imagine people will be interested in you?"" he told her. ""They won't ever, really, just for yourself. Even if you think people like you, it will only be a kind of curiosity they will have about a person whose life has touched mine so intimately.""Yet Gilot's paintings continued to sell. She viewed her break from Picasso as the beginning of her ""real life"" as a successful artist and went on to produce more than 6000 drawings, paintings and ceramics. ""I said watch out, because I came when I wanted to, but I will leave when I want,"" recalled Gilot, the only lover to have voluntarily left Picasso.She was born Marie Francoise Gilot in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a wealthy Parisian suburb, the only child of Emile Gilot, an agronomist and chemical manufacturer, and Madeleine (nee Renoult), a ceramicist and watercolour painter. Francoise was homeschooled until the age of 10, and though naturally left-handed, her father forced her to write with her right hand.Her early years were privileged but lonely, and in art she discovered a world ""in which I could express myself in a way that made sense to me"". Her mother taught her to paint and took her on regular trips to the Louvre. Her father, however, wanted her to become a lawyer.After the Germans invaded Paris she was briefly detained by French police for laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which commemorated the 1918 Armistice.In 1942 Gilot dropped out of law school and enrolled at an art school on the Left Bank. ""Officially"" she was her father's secretary and a fashion designer, a career the Germans considered politically benign, but she began secretly to paint under the tutelage of Endre Rozsda, the Hungarian-French surrealist. When her father found out he beat her and tried to have her committed to a psychiatric ward, and she moved in with her grandmother. After leaving Picasso and Paris in the 1950s she moved to America, where most of her collectors were based. In 1962 she divorced her first husband, Luc Simon, a French artist, and in California met Dr Jonas Salk, an American virologist who invented the first polio vaccine. When he proposed she initially refused, and he asked her to write down the reasons why. The list included: ""I can't live more than six months with one person"" and ""I'm not always in the mood to talk. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."" He found the list ""quite congenial"" and they were married in 1970. Salk died in 1995.Gilot's best-selling memoir, Life with Picasso (1964)caused a stir for its frank depiction of the irascible artist (who lost three lawsuits to stop its publication and then cut all ties with their children).

Dispute over a Pablo Picasso - is 'Madame Soler' looted art?,Daily Times,05 Mar 2023,"Full TextTranslateUndo Translation Learn more about TranslateFromSelect language...ArabicChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CzechDanishEnglishFinnishFrenchGerman HebrewIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanPolishPortugueseRussianSpanishSwedishTurkishTo TranslateTranslation in progress...

This was the intense look that painter Pablo Picasso captured in 1903 of the wife of his friend, tailor Benet Soler. The portrait, part of Picasso's Blue Period, has since become the subject of a protracted and bitter dispute between the heirs of Jewish banker and art collector Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and the Bavarian State Painting Collections. Both sides are claiming rightful ownership of ""Madame Soler.""The Bavarian State Painting Collections is the custodian of a large part of the public art collections belonging to the Free State of Bavaria, as well as the Bavarian museums and public art galleries in which these artworks are exhibited.This dispute over ""Madame Soler"" is complicated because the parties disagree on whether the painting was sold under duress - in the context of the persecution and dispossession of Jews in Nazi Germany starting in 1933. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence to this end. Since it is not possible in Germany to legally sue for statute-barred restitution claims - and because US courts have denied jurisdiction - the dispute over ""Madame Soler"" has reached an impasse. Public pressure is being used to break this deadlock. There is one possible recourse in Germany in such cases: the Limbach Commission. Set up in 2003 by the German government, the commission can be called upon to mediate in disputes involving the restitution of Nazi-looted art especially from persecuted Jewish citizens during the Third Reich, which are now held by museums, libraries, archives or other public institutions in Germany. It can then review the case and make legally non-binding - though morally no-less important - recommendations to settle the dispute. However, the disputing parties must both agree to the Commission reviewing their case. The Bavarian State Painting Collections, however, has shown itself unwilling to take this step.Together with his first wife, Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy had amassed a considerable private collection of modern artists in Berlin, which may have included Picasso's ""Madame Soler"" as early as 1913/14, but at the latest from 1930. But in 1934, the manager of the Lucerne branch of the art dealer Justin K Thannhauser noted that there was evidence of intentions to sell. Thannhauser, himself a Jew, had helped to establish the painter's worldwide fame with his major Picasso exhibition in Munich in 1913. Mendelssohn-Bartholdy died of a heart attack on May 11, 1935 and his second wife became his heir. In August 1935, ""Madame Soler"" was listed by the Thannhauser Gallery in Berlin as ""purchased."" In October 1935, Thannhauser offered the painting for sale along with four other works by Picasso. But he himself came under increasing pressure in Nazi Germany, went to Paris and fled from there in 1940 - with many unframed works in his luggage - to the USA.""Madame Soler"" henceforth became part of Thannhauser's private collection in New York - prominently placed and clearly visible to guests. In November 1964, the Bavarian State Painting Collections acquired Picasso's ""Madame Soler"" for 1.7 million Swiss francs or 1.6 million Deutschmark from Justin Thannhauser through a company based in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. The Mendelssohn-Bartholdy heirs doubt that the painting was sold without pressure on their ancestor, or that it was sold at all. Apart from the internal documentation of the Thannhauser Gallery, there is no direct evidence of the purchase itself. It is therefore also possible that the painting was only sold on commission by Thannhauser. This is the argument of Julius H. Schoeps, historian, holder of the Federal Cross of Merit and descendant of Mendelssohn-Bartholdy - not only in the statement of claim, but also in his book ""Who owns Picasso's Madame Soler?"" published in 2022. He considers it probable that Mendelssohn-Bartholdy gave the paintings to Thannhauser on commission, in order to find a buyer before they were confiscated by the Nazi authorities. He had not sold a single painting before, but between 1933 and 1935 he sold 15 of his paintings. The Free State of Bavaria, however, maintains that the painting ""does not constitute cultural property seized by the Nazis."" In the case of the four other Picasso paintings that were sold, the heirs have reached settlements with the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation. In each case, the works remained in the collections in exchange for the payment of an undisclosed sum of money. The National Gallery in Boston returned its Picasso to the heirs.Since it does not currently look as if a restitution law will be introduced in Germany soon or if the Limbach Commission processes will be reformed to allow a right of appeal, even unilaterally, the only recourse left is public debate.Of course, the Bavarian State Painting Collections can continue to insist on its position and try to sit out the controversy over ""Madame Soler."" But, the emphatic insistence of the heirs that an injustice has been done could be reason enough for the Limbach Commission to seek clarification.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Times.Word count: 844Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

It took a full seven years to list and catalog all the paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and texts he had created - about 150,000 works. Legal disputes have continued over the ensuing 50 years, and now the largest single collection of his works is in the Picasso Museum in Paris. (Also read: Pablo Picasso: 10 facts about the Spanish artist)One of his legal heirs is Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, Picasso's grandson, who was 13 years old at the time of the artist's death. Twenty years ago, he and his mother donated part of their private collection to found the Picasso Museum in Malaga, Spain - Picasso's birthplace.DW met the art collector in Paris.DW: When did you first realize that your grandfather was one of the greatest artistic geniuses of the 20th century?Bernard Ruiz-Picasso: I realized that he was an important person before his death in 1973.As a child, I used to visit him in the south of France. He was surrounded by many friends and he had a big house full of art. He was very busy.I was young, so I did not really notice how important he was on an artistic level, but in his life, I realized that people paid attention to him. He was not treated like a carpenter or an electrician. He was different.How do you remember him? Was he a kind grandfather?When I was young, times were different. Children weren't allowed to interrupt adults. When I was playing on the floor of the living room, he was talking with other adults, sometimes he asked me to come to sit with him or he showed me something and took me in his arms like grandfathers do.You founded the Picasso Museum in Malaga 20 years ago. How does this museum commemorate Picasso? And how is the 50th anniversary of his death going to be marked?In fact, it's a coincidence that we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the museum in Malaga and the 50th anniversary of Picasso's death.So we're going to celebrate this institution with an update of where we are, and we'll try to make the museum ready for the future.Museums and their visitors have changed a lot in the last 20 years. It's a long process, things are slow in a museum, but we are really in a moment where museums around the world are questioning their missions, and we share those questions with other institutions.Picasso spent his childhood in Malaga. How did these years influence his work?There is no doubt that for any artist, their early years are highly influential. In Picasso's case, you can really see all the colors of his childhood in his work, how they appear in his paintings: the orange, the yellow, the lemon. The colors of Malaga influenced Picasso a lot.And his father was a very good artist, specializing in still life, called ""Bodegones"" in Spanish. He was a teacher at an arts school at Malaga that contributed to many artistic developments in architecture, in design and applied arts. Pablo Picasso, or I should even say his father Pablo Ruiz, had started life surrounded by culture and art.And as a city, Malaga has changed a lot because of the Picasso Museum and also other art institutions. It has become an artistic town.Picasso's relationship with women is increasingly criticized today. Why did you once say in an interview that he was a feminist?That's a quote taken out of context by a French journalist in a Spanish newspaper. But yes, I think the way he portrayed himself, but especially the way he portrayed women - as mothers, as lovers, as terrifying, hysterical characters - that is extraordinary. In this context, an exhibition at the Musee d'Orsay on the Blue and Rose Periods opened my eyes. There I learned to see his works in a new way. These early paintings depicted women who had syphilis or were in prison completely starved. Picasso was always against tyranny and barbarism in all areas.Did the painting Guernica mark his turn as a political artist?From a very young age, Picasso was engaged with many different groups of people who were fighting to improve their living conditions.Guernica is one example. He painted it as a commission for the Spanish pavilion during the international fair in Paris in 1937. But he also did paintings about the war in Korea and, in the 1940s, he portrayed women who had been mutilated during the Second World War.I think he was an artist who was very sensitive, who saw the joy and also the pain of life.When Picasso died it was difficult to share his estate. You had to give a big part to the French state. How was it sorted out then?Picasso passed away in 1973. Then my father passed away two years later, unfortunately. And my half sister Marina lost a brother who committed suicide in 1973. All that was pretty sad. So six of us were left: Maya, Paloma, Claude, Jacqueline, Picasso's widow, Marina and I. The lawyers and the French government had created the idea of ""dation"" - using artworks to pay inheritance tax - which was a very good system. I think it was Georges Pompidou who initiated it in his time as president. So the Picasso Museum in Paris got a beautiful collection. The family also donated his private collection including paintings by Cezanne, Matisse and all the archives. So we gave them a lot of documents which enabled them to reconstruct the life and work of Picasso.He did a lot of paintings of your grandmother. Do you own some of them?I own a few things from my grandmother. I worked for 10 years on the translation of my grandmother's Russian correspondence. We organized an exhibition called ""Olga and Picasso,"" in Paris, Moscow, Malaga and Madrid. And we did a lot of research because we had no idea who Olga actually was. It's a sad story from the times of the Civil War. She came to Europe as a young ballet dancer in 1911 and met Picasso in 1917. At Picasso's side she led a dream-like life, almost like a little princess. But while Picasso became increasingly famous towards the end of WWII, she lost her entire family on the other side. They died in the civil war or in the army.There are a lot of exhibitions commemorating Picasso in 2023. Are you going to see all of them?I'm trying to figure out how to be in two places at the same time! No, I'm not going to see all of them. But I want to travel a lot in 2023, because I think it's worth seeing many of them. I think both presidents of France and Spain have had this idea to end this year of celebration at the UNESCO in Paris. This will also be a statement for democracy.Interview by Sabine Oelze and Susanne Luerweg.

The Kurator catches up with Stanley to find out more‚Ä¶What can you tell us about your latest exhibition ""Treasures"" in Dubai?I met the Art K≈çrero team in Dubai, and after reviewing my artwork and visiting my studio a few times they came up with the idea of exhibiting my paintings in collaboration with Pablo Picasso's family and their collection. Together we launched the art exhibition we call ""Treasures and the World of Pablo Picasso.‚ÄùWhat connects you and your work to Picasso?This exhibition includes art that I created during the 1990s until around 2000, and the Art K≈çrero team saw a connection between my work and Picasso‚Äôs. It turns out to be a beautiful exhibition as seen at ME Hotel Dubai from July to September 2022. In both my work and Picasso's, you can see a strong love of life and of women and beauty‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about bringing the beauty of life to art.How does your creative life fit in with Dubai?I came to Dubai 14 years ago, and I had never heard of Dubai before. So the first year was all about adapting to a new home. Then slowly I held a few art exhibitions here, and through the years, I have learned to like it and call it home now. The UAE and Dubai in recent years have grown with many art galleries, encouraging local people and international visitors to experience them. But perhaps there is also an opportunity to introduce people to art and not just display it for sale.How did you discover your creativity, and how did you nurture it into artistry?I discovered that I had some talent when I was about 12, when I babysat my younger brother while he took an art class. The art teacher happened to see some of my drawings as I was outside the room, waiting to take my brother home, and he insisted to my parents that I should take art classes too, which I did. Then, after graduating from the Fine Arts University of Hanoi, Vietnam, I worked as an artist and as an art magazine editor. I had my first solo exhibition in Vietnam before relocating to the USA. Since then, I‚Äôve had many art shows in the USA, UK, Hong Kong, Monaco and Dubai.What do you like about the lifestyle in Dubai, and what do you most miss about your home country VietNam?Dubai is a busy place where something is always happening. But I have learned how to balance between all the activities, events, my private life and my art. My ""art world"" is my own space where I can keep learning how to stay in balance with the beautiful side of life and not let the rest of life take it away from me. What I miss the most from home is the authentic Vietnamese cuisine. There is only one original.How do you view the art scene in the UAE? Where do you see it going in the future?Many art galleries have come and gone since I came to Dubai 14 years ago, but there are more galleries now than I can remember. Perhaps, there should be more places to help educate people about what art is and why art can be a big part of our culture. Showing off your art collection is something you should be proud of. Buying art should be natural as you understand, appreciate, and acknowledge it. You don't have to always spend a fortune to be an art collector. You can start by buying an artwork as something you love. I would hope that the UAE market will continue blooming, not just for Middle Eastern art but for international art.What does the concept of home mean to you? Why do you prefer painting in a solitary environment?Home is where the heart is and to me home is also a space where you breathe art. It‚Äôs where you display the collection you love, and the journeys you‚Äôve made in your life that can transform into artwork or be transformed by an artwork. An artist is a creator, and a creator needs space and quiet. Most of the time during the day I prefer silence (except when something unusual disturbs the schedule), and I like quiet music (just music, no words). Wherever I can think, paint, write, or think of a drawing or stare at something that means to be an artwork, is home to me.You've lived in London, New York, Hong Kong‚Ä¶ What fascinates you most about different cultures and ways of life?I have relocated so many times, between cities and within them, that just when I feel about to settle down I have to leave again. It's not easy: your life gets turned upside down all over again. But during that process, I‚Äôve also learned so much about many different cultures, lifestyles, habitats, histories, music, museums‚Ä¶ And at the same time, you learn so much about yourself.What are you most proud of, and what do you most look forward to?I never think of proud moments, I just keep looking toward in life. The moments that always make me feel happy are when my art is exhibited somewhere in the public or in a private collector‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúTomorrow will always be better than today‚Äù is my motto, so one of my dreams is to have an art show at an art museum, perhaps in the UAE.Do you have any words of advice for budding artists in the region?Being an artist is never easy, it‚Äôs hard. Life doesn't accept excuses for it. But what you need is a passion for anything you want to do, and you must do it with love. There is no substitute for that.Word count: 970Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Email reporters@press.co.nzWhen Francoise Gilot, who has died aged 101, first met Pablo Picasso one afternoon in May 1943 he spotted her at Le Catalan restaurant in Paris and brought her a bowl of cherries - he laughed when she told him that she was a painter, too.""That is the funniest thing I've heard all day,"" said the greying demigod of the art world. ""Girls who look like you can't be painters."" At 21, Gilot indeed exuded youth and a dark beauty, but the 62-year-old Picasso was also attracted by her unapologetic manner and her sharp, independent mind. .That a romance evolved owed more, Gilot later said, to World War II and the absence of any men her age than to any natural attraction to a man 40 years her senior. ""It was not a time like any other,"" she recalled. ""It was a time when everything was lost; a time of death. So: do I want to do something before I die or not? You have to seize it.""The relationship was never sentimental - she once described it as a ""catastrophe I didn't want to avoid"" - but it was creative and intellectually stimulating; Picasso encouraged her to study Cubism and his style permeated her paintings. Picasso, in turn, produced thousands of paintings and drawings of his young muse, often depicting her in cool blues and olive greens.During the 10-year relationship Picasso was emotionally and physically abusive. When Gilot once enjoyed a seaside trip without him, he afterwards held a lit cigarette to her right cheek, later painting the scar in his 1946 portrait of her, Femme au collier jaune. By way of apology he introduced her to one of her greatest inspirations, Matisse.In the late 1940s Gilot became restless and Picasso persuaded her that a child would settle her down. In 1947 she gave birth to a son, Claude, followed two years later by a daughter, Paloma, but she hated being pregnant and Picasso complained that their lives had become too staid.By the early 1950s his capricious moods and casual cruelty had become unbearable and he had taken other lovers. When, in September 1953, Gilot decided to leave him, Picasso set about alienating her from Paris's art world and tried to persuade dealers not to buy her work.""You imagine people will be interested in you?"" he told her. ""They won't ever, really, just for yourself. Even if you think people like you, it will only be a kind of curiosity they will have about a person whose life has touched mine so intimately.""Yet Gilot's paintings continued to sell. She viewed her break from Picasso as the beginning of her ""real life"" as a successful artist and went on to produce more than 6000 drawings, paintings and ceramics. ""I said watch out, because I came when I wanted to, but I will leave when I want,"" recalled Gilot, the only lover to have voluntarily left Picasso.She was born Marie Francoise Gilot in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a wealthy Parisian suburb, the only child of Emile Gilot, an agronomist and chemical manufacturer, and Madeleine (nee Renoult), a ceramicist and watercolour painter. Francoise was homeschooled until the age of 10, and though naturally left-handed, her father forced her to write with her right hand.Her early years were privileged but lonely, and in art she discovered a world ""in which I could express myself in a way that made sense to me"". Her mother taught her to paint and took her on regular trips to the Louvre. Her father, however, wanted her to become a lawyer.After the Germans invaded Paris she was briefly detained by French police for laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which commemorated the 1918 Armistice.In 1942 Gilot dropped out of law school and enrolled at an art school on the Left Bank. ""Officially"" she was her father's secretary and a fashion designer, a career the Germans considered politically benign, but she began secretly to paint under the tutelage of Endre Rozsda, the Hungarian-French surrealist. When her father found out he beat her and tried to have her committed to a psychiatric ward, and she moved in with her grandmother. After leaving Picasso and Paris in the 1950s she moved to America, where most of her collectors were based. In 1962 she divorced her first husband, Luc Simon, a French artist, and in California met Dr Jonas Salk, an American virologist who invented the first polio vaccine. When he proposed she initially refused, and he asked her to write down the reasons why. The list included: ""I can't live more than six months with one person"" and ""I'm not always in the mood to talk. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."" He found the list ""quite congenial"" and they were married in 1970. Salk died in 1995.Gilot's best-selling memoir, Life with Picasso (1964)caused a stir for its frank depiction of the irascible artist (who lost three lawsuits to stop its publication and then cut all ties with their children). Gilot never stopped painting. In 2021 she celebrated her 100th birthday with a solo exhibition in Hong Kong, and her 1965 painting Paloma a la Guitare, a portrait of her daughter, sold for US$1.3 million in an online auction.

You have to seize it.""The relationship was never sentimental - she once described it as a ""catastrophe I didn't want to avoid"" - but it was creative and intellectually stimulating; Picasso encouraged her to study Cubism and his style permeated her paintings. Picasso, in turn, produced thousands of paintings and drawings of his young muse, often depicting her in cool blues and olive greens.During the 10-year relationship Picasso was emotionally and physically abusive. When Gilot once enjoyed a seaside trip without him, he afterwards held a lit cigarette to her right cheek, later painting the scar in his 1946 portrait of her, Femme au collier jaune. By way of apology he introduced her to one of her greatest inspirations, Matisse.In the late 1940s Gilot became restless and Picasso persuaded her that a child would settle her down. In 1947 she gave birth to a son, Claude, followed two years later by a daughter, Paloma, but she hated being pregnant and Picasso complained that their lives had become too staid.By the early 1950s his capricious moods and casual cruelty had become unbearable and he had taken other lovers. When, in September 1953, Gilot decided to leave him, Picasso set about alienating her from Paris's art world and tried to persuade dealers not to buy her work.""You imagine people will be interested in you?"" he told her. ""They won't ever, really, just for yourself. Even if you think people like you, it will only be a kind of curiosity they will have about a person whose life has touched mine so intimately.""Yet Gilot's paintings continued to sell. She viewed her break from Picasso as the beginning of her ""real life"" as a successful artist and went on to produce more than 6000 drawings, paintings and ceramics. ""I said watch out, because I came when I wanted to, but I will leave when I want,"" recalled Gilot, the only lover to have voluntarily left Picasso.She was born Marie Francoise Gilot in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a wealthy Parisian suburb, the only child of Emile Gilot, an agronomist and chemical manufacturer, and Madeleine (nee Renoult), a ceramicist and watercolour painter. Francoise was homeschooled until the age of 10, and though naturally left-handed, her father forced her to write with her right hand.Her early years were privileged but lonely, and in art she discovered a world ""in which I could express myself in a way that made sense to me"". Her mother taught her to paint and took her on regular trips to the Louvre. Her father, however, wanted her to become a lawyer.After the Germans invaded Paris she was briefly detained by French police for laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which commemorated the 1918 Armistice.In 1942 Gilot dropped out of law school and enrolled at an art school on the Left Bank. ""Officially"" she was her father's secretary and a fashion designer, a career the Germans considered politically benign, but she began secretly to paint under the tutelage of Endre Rozsda, the Hungarian-French surrealist. When her father found out he beat her and tried to have her committed to a psychiatric ward, and she moved in with her grandmother. After leaving Picasso and Paris in the 1950s she moved to America, where most of her collectors were based. In 1962 she divorced her first husband, Luc Simon, a French artist, and in California met Dr Jonas Salk, an American virologist who invented the first polio vaccine. When he proposed she initially refused, and he asked her to write down the reasons why. The list included: ""I can't live more than six months with one person"" and ""I'm not always in the mood to talk. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."" He found the list ""quite congenial"" and they were married in 1970. Salk died in 1995.Gilot's best-selling memoir, Life with Picasso (1964)caused a stir for its frank depiction of the irascible artist (who lost three lawsuits to stop its publication and then cut all ties with their children). Gilot never stopped painting. In 2021 she celebrated her 100th birthday with a solo exhibition in Hong Kong, and her 1965 painting Paloma a la Guitare, a portrait of her daughter, sold for US$1.3 million in an online auction. She never owned a Picasso. - The TimesCAPTION:Francoise Gilot at an exhibition of her work in Milan in 1965.

Picasso in his underwear, Picasso in a bow tie. Harlequin Picasso, bullfight Picasso, the poets' Picasso, the GIs' Picasso. Anti-fascist Picasso, communist Picasso, peace dove Picasso. Prankster Picasso, heartsick Picasso, lecherous Picasso.Yes, Pablo Picasso was all over the place. He died 50 years ago this month at 91, and we're still trying to clean up his mess.Where America's celebrated postwar artists - Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Helen Frankenthaler, Roy Lichtenstein - had the good manners to settle on a tidy, signature style and stick to it, Picasso was the ultimate shapeshifter. As an artist - and as a man - he was so astonishingly manifold that we are left with little choice, it can seem, but to reduce him to a kind of sign. Picasso equals protean genius.It's no longer necessary that he connect in people's minds with any actual art. It's enough that he stands for that bigger thing: unfettered creativity. In fact, it's better. A clear line connects Picasso's description of his pictures as ""a sum of destructions"" and the capitalist mantra of ""creative destruction"" and the onetime internal Facebook motto ""Move fast and break things."" Sublimating Picasso's oeuvre into an essence of pure creativity certainly makes it easier for the marketing arms of corporations to invoke his name and for museums to sell tickets.This year, in Europe and North America, around 50 exhibitions have been organized under the umbrella ""Celebration Picasso 1973-2023,"" an initiative with the support of the French and Spanish governments. Some will try to solve the problem of the Spaniard's extraordinary productivity by focusing on one year in his life (""Picasso 1906: The Turning Point"" at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid) or even just three months (""Picasso in Fontainebleau"" at New York's Museum of Modern Art). Others - too many to list - will tame him by matching his works with those of other artists (El Greco, Max Beckmann, Nicolas Poussin, Joan Mir√≥), with writers (Gertrude Stein) or with lovers (Fernande Olivier, Fran√ßoise Gilot). In June, the Brooklyn Museum will mount a show, co-curated by the comedian Hannah Gadsby, looking at Picasso through a feminist lens, placing him beside such artists as Cindy Sherman, Ana Mendieta and Kiki Smith.What will people see in all these shows? How will Picasso's actual works affect them? How good will the Spaniard come out smelling? That last question sounds impertinent, but it's worth asking if we care about art, as opposed to branding.I was recently at dinner with a celebrated artist and his wife, a physician. Thinking ahead to this essay, I raised the subject of Picasso. ""Obviously, he was amazing,"" I said to the physician. ""But are there any Picassos you really love? Any of his works that sit with you, that feel close to your heart? Because I sometimes struggle to think of any."" Her husband, the artist, overheard from across the room and said simply, ""Dozens. There are dozens.""He was right, of course. And it is artists, above all, for whom Picasso has been an endless source of ideas, envy and inspiration. A critic trying to question or undermine this is bound to sound foolish, presumptuous and glib.And yet ‚Ä¶ questioning Picasso's greatness is part of a venerable critical tradition. Despite the underlying consensus, there have been many productively provocative naysayers. The ones that linger most in my mind are John Berger's 1965 book ""The Success and Failure of Picasso,"" Adam Gopnik's 1996 New Yorker essay ""Escaping Picasso"" and Gadsby's brief, comedic takedown of the artist in her Netflix documentary ""Nanette."" All three recognized Picasso's importance, acknowledged his brilliance. But each was willing, in different ways, to question the accepted wisdom by making connections between Picasso's character and his art.A narrow imaginationThat Picasso was misogynistic is not really in doubt. Yes, he was electrifying company, and, yes, many intelligent and formidable women fell in love with him. But again and again (the record is clear), he treated them abominably. Misogyny is the symptom of a narrow, thwarted imagination. Picasso's intelligence was immense and wide-ranging, but he made his art narrower, less interesting, by turning so much of it into a bizarrely obsessive index to the churning hysteria of his ambivalence toward women.Reviewers of successive volumes of John Richardson's ""A Life of Picasso"" found themselves unable to ignore the issue. The writer Siri Hustvedt, reviewing the fourth and final volume, spoke of Picasso's ""malignant narcissism,"" adding that, despite his brilliance, ""the emotional repertoire of the work, especially as he aged, is far narrower than often perceived.""Responding to the third volume, Hilary Spurling, in the Guardian, noted that ""large stretches of this book read like a code-breaker's manual"" (for interpreting Picasso's habit of using his art to settle scores and scatter sex organs). The ""emotional core"" of the volume, she wrote, was ""Richardson's detailed report, horrific and dispassionate, of repeated pictorial assaults as affection seeped out of Picasso's portraits of [his wife] Olga [Khokhlova] to be replaced by rancour and rage."" Gadsby put it most succinctly in ""Nanette."" Acknowledging the importance of cubism, she nonetheless blasted Picasso for his lack of imagination. He ""just put a kaleidoscope filter on his penis,"" she said.Richardson, who died in 2019, had a credible theory that Picasso saw himself as an exorcist or shaman. The idea was grounded in the artist's childhood and in things he later said about his 1907 breakthrough, ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."" The Spaniard was interrogating, Richardson argued, ""the atavistic misogyny toward women that supposedly lurks in the psyche of every full-blooded Andalusian male."" ""What this seems to mean,"" concluded Spurling in her review, ""is that hatred of women fueled many of Picasso's greatest works.""It's worth noting the semantic slide here from the idea that Picasso was interrogating misogyny to Spurling's conclusion that his work was fueled by it. Clearly they overlap, but there is also a difference. The age-old war between the sexes is, after all, a legitimate subject of art. Artworks that powerfully express sexual enmity (and Picasso's oeuvre is full of them) can be an antidote to the complacencies of, for instance, male feminists who think they have it all figured out and fail to acknowledge what Germaine Greer called the ""radical, tragic and overwhelming"" nature of gender conflict and ""the utter inability of either sex to comprehend the other.""Picasso's presentation of the conflict, in works like ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,"" can be so confronting that we feel the papery veil we refer to as ""civilization"" shriveling before our eyes.But then, it can also become incredibly tedious. Ten years before Spurling's review, Gopnik, in a New Yorker essay prompted by the publication of the second volume of the Richardson biography, noted that the trouble with so many Picasso works ""was less the misogyny of the subjects"" - pervasive as that was - ""than the banality of their articulation.""This, I think, is spot on. Picasso's pictorial pyrotechnics can be astounding. But the emotional core - or an emotional core that we might care about - often seems absent. Gopnik's essay was hugely controversial at the time. But a quarter century on, it looks courageously clearheaded, and in many ways, the world has come around to the heretical position he advanced.One of Gopnik's most contentious claims was that Picasso's best work was confined to the ""fifteen-year period centered on cubism, the First World War, and its immediate aftermath."" Surrounding this high period, he wrote, ""was a vast sea of kitsch, an almost bottomless vulgarity of imagination, an ugliness that was not the honest Medusa's-head ugliness of modernism but the glaring ugliness of falseness and sentimentality."" ""What made cubism great,"" he declared, ""is not that it gave Picasso a means of self-expression, but that it acted as a barrier to self-expression - pretty much the only one he ever met.""The final claim chimes amusingly with T.S. Eliot's influential theory that great art was impersonal. Instead of expressing the poet's personality, he argued, poetry (or art) should be thought of as an ""escape from personality."" (""But of course,"" he added ominously, ""only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things."") It's easy to say, following Eliot, that we should separate art from the moral failings of its creators. But it's difficult for most of us to abandon the idea that art can, in fact, be an expression of inner life, and often is. With certain artists - and Picasso was one of them - the connection is so powerful that it is self-evident.So what happens if we are turned off, appalled or simply bored by what we surmise of an artist's inner life?Embracing conflictIt's obviously a problem. But are there really no great Picassos outside that 15-year period? Did nothing else he made connect with valuable meanings, emotional depth, truth? Gopnik told me by email that he has since moderated his views, which he now considers ""not altogether wrong but terribly overstated."" But I think his argument back then was salutary. It is ""astonishing,"" as he added in the email, ""how fast a critical consensus can shift; in 1996 to say such things was shocking; now only the opposite would.""I've always found it hard to see Picasso's best work clearly. I suspect one problem is my emotional bias toward Matisse, his great rival. Another is my sense that the early work, especially the Blue Period, was maudlin, while much of the late work was self-indulgent. A third obstacle is the sheer number of Picassos out there: He made around 13,500 paintings, 100,000 prints, 700 sculptures and more than 4,000 ceramics. There are only so many times you can see Picasso use the same notation for a nose to switch a frontal portrait to a side profile before the trick feels hammy. Remove the calcified rhetoric - Picasso the ""genius,"" the ""geyser of creativity"" - and you're left with a body of work whose human meanings can seem disappointingly thin.But I've also reviewed probably a dozen Picasso exhibitions over the years. And I have to admit that each time I've been forced to contemplate his achievement honestly and up close, with his weaker things weeded out by discerning curators, I've come away shaking my head in wonder.You don't have to wait for the next great exhibition. We're fortunate: American museums hold many of Picasso's finest works. Cleveland has ""La Vie."" Chicago has ""The Old Guitarist."" The National Gallery of Art has ""Lady With a Fan."" Philadelphia has the early ""Self-Portrait With Palette."" The Met has ""Gertrude Stein"" and some of Picasso's greatest cubist pictures. Many museums hold versions of the ""Vollard Suite"" or his haunting 1935 print ""Minotauromachy.""The Museum of Modern Art has ‚Ä¶ a lot. You could start with the tremblingly beautiful ""Two Nudes,"" in which two pneumatically inflated yet oddly compressed female bodies appear as if freshly hatched from an exhausted 19th century. You might then move on to ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,"" the most terrifying of all modern paintings; ""Ma Jolie,"" Picasso's early cubist conjurer's trick; ""Glass of Absinthe,"" a modest little trinket that completely revolutionized modern sculpture; ""Girl Before a Mirror,"" his bright, captivating take on an age-old metaphysical fascination; and ""Woman Dressing her Hair,"" one of the great evocations of the disturbing nearness of erotic attraction and repulsion.But when appraising Picasso, you can't just single out masterpieces and ignore the cumulative effect of his inventiveness - the sense in which he was continuously involved in a series of, as he put it, ""researches."" His bewildering productivity can tempt us to categorize much of his output as casual, lightweight or somehow unserious. But - as artists like Paul Klee, Mir√≥ and Matisse also showed - things can be playful and profound at the same time. Picasso did more than anyone to entrench that liberating modern insight.A born performer, Picasso was forever changing the rules, converting known things into new things. A friend of many poets, he treated graphic marks as his own freshly minted language and, like the best poets, loved contriving collisions that forced new meanings to emerge. His work was diaristic, but he was always abstracting aspects of his life into the realms of myth and philosophy, where life, death, time and transformation are all part of the same trembling, interconnected phenomenon. This is what gave the dark, erotic wildness of his surrealist years such power. But it informed his entire career.Picasso was not, primarily, a sculptor, yet his intelligence in three dimensions was nothing short of flabbergasting. When he turned bodies and faces inside out, he could seem to be turning love and repulsion themselves inside out, so that what you are left with, psychologically, was never what you came in with. He understood (to a frankly disturbing degree) the truth in Degas's statement that ""the people you love the most are the people you could hate the most.""The tensions he set up everywhere between two- and three-dimensional forms spoke profoundly to a deep human conflict between seeming (the ways we present ourselves and the ways others project onto us) and being (the way we are). He gave this existential tension a depth that, in its sheer turbulence, felt uniquely modern.When Picasso abstracted recognizable images into the realm of signs and myths, as he repeatedly did, he was expressing intuitions about how consciousness relates to the objective world, to archetypes and to our ability to communicate - with obvious implications for the conditions of possibility for love.Of course, the idea of being interested in what Picasso the misogynist had to say about love might not come easily to many. But this is one of the senses in which Eliot was, after all, right: Art is in a dynamic dialogue not only with other art but also with objective reality. When the force of both is unleashed, it really can float free of its makers. Biographies are great (Richardson's, in particular, is full of insight), but we are not bound to see every artwork in biographical terms.""The rapacity of Picasso's pillaging eye,"" wrote Spurling (who was, incidentally, Matisse's biographer), ""was matched by the velocity and precision of his responses. ‚Ä¶ He resaw, rethought and recreated the world by smash-and-grab, wrenching form apart, ripping out connections."" Spurling's vivid word choices evoke a violence and ruthlessness that we have come to associate as much with the man as his artistic powers. But it's good to remember that we can be as ruthless and selfish about our own uses for Picasso as he was about the art and people he exploited.We don't owe him anything. But we can surely continue to make use of his art.Word count: 2479Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Based on the provided news article content, I would classify the potential impact on Pablo Picasso's reputation, visibility, and market confidence as:

Classification: High

The article asks critical questions about Picasso's artistic legacy and challenges prevailing opinions about his greatness. It implies that there may be a need to reassess Picasso's position in the art world, which could lead to increased interest and appreciation of his work. The article's focus on reevaluating Picasso's work suggests that it has the potential to enhance his reputation and increase visibility among collectors, galleries, and the general public. Additionally, the article's mention of recent skyrocketing sales and celebrity endorsements could further boost market confidence in the artist's work as a sound investment.",

Currently the sixth highest-selling painting by the Cubism master, it depicts his lover Dora seated on a chair with a small cat perched on her shoulders. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings in the world after it achieved a price of $95 million at Sotheby‚Äôs on 3 May 2006. Though it is a part of a private collection, several art lovers continue to analyse this painting through photographs and documents. But why did Picasso choose to paint this? What significance does it hold for him and the art world?Picasso and his bittersweet love storyPicasso was 60 years old when he chose to paint his 34-year-old mistress and muse Dora Maar. During their decade-long relationship, Picasso painted several portraits of her including the very famous The Weeping Woman. Dora Maar is one of Picasso‚Äôs most mysterious and controversial mistresses. She was known to have a lot of influence on the artist as she was an intelligent woman who would discuss political issues of the day with him. As an artist, they would share ideas and she was much more of an equal to Pablo than he was to his other women. Dora was a well-known photographer who took the only visual documentation of Picasso‚Äôs Guernica in development. This bittersweet love affair began when Picasso fell in love with her on the set of Jean Renoir‚Äôs film Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, where she was working as a movie photographer. Although they shared a very intimate relationship for years, when Picasso painted Dora Maar au Chat in 1941, it was the beginning of World War II. When the Nazis occupied France, the tension between the couple increased, resulting in Picasso portraying his lover in a much more abstract way. He also started depicting her in tears such as in The Weeping Woman. They eventually separated in 1946 after which Maar suffered a nervous breakdown and required psychiatric treatment in a hospital during which she underwent electric-shock therapy. Despite several years of treatment, she continued to be tormented by Picasso and turned to Roman Catholicism and mysticism. It is said even though she continued to paint‚Äîmostly still lifes and landscapes‚Äîand to photograph, she became a recluse. Over the years, as her main source of income, she sold what she owned that had been made by her ex-lover Picasso.What does the painting mean and why is it expensivePicasso was 60 years old when he chose to paint his 34-year-old mistress and muse Dora Maar. (Photo: pablopicasso.org)Despite the tragic ending of Picasso‚Äôs affair with Maar, Dora Maar au Chat continues to be one of Picasso‚Äôs most valued depictions of his lover. Their partnership had been one of scholarly exchange and intense devotion as Dora was an artist who spoke Picasso‚Äôs native Spanish and shared his political concerns. This portrait pays the most tremendous respect to Maar, mainly concentrating on her face and attire with very little attention to the background. It shows her sitting on a simple wooden chair with a small black cat sitting over her shoulder. Picasso loved women and animals and this can be seen in his works. But why did he choose to paint a cat on his lover‚Äôs shoulder? According to various art critics, the cat symbolises the feminine sexual values of Picasso‚Äôs mistress and speaks directly to the viewer about the main focal point of the painting. Picasso once compared his lover‚Äôs temperament with an Afghan cat, which is a powerful illusory comment, considering the nature of their relationship. Picasso painted long fingers and long nails into the portrait which closely resembles the reportedly well-manicured nails and hands that Maar was known to have. Her hands were said to be her most distinctive and beautiful features, however, Picasso painted them in such a way as to depict them as possessing certain violence, like a cat‚Äôs claws.The use of colour is one of the main reasons why this painting is so well-liked both by the audience and the artist. It captures his feelings towards Dora Maar and offered the viewers an insight into their relationship. Several articles which were characteristic of Maar are to be found carefully added to this canvas, such as her hat which she was remembered for regularly wearing. Many have argued that the inclusion of the hat in this artwork also points to her involvement in the Surrealist movement. Another reason why this painting is so famous is because of the cubist approach Picasso took to paint it. He purposely painted Dora Maar‚Äôs torso giving a three-dimensional look, almost as if a sculptured statue. Whilst the background is simple in content, just some floorboards and interior space, the artist still managed to create some interest around it by imparting his cubist approach here as well. There is an undoubtedly regal look to Dora Maar in this painting. She is seen sitting proudly like a queen surveying her subjects from a throne.There is little doubt that Dora Maar au Chat is an exceptional painting in terms of its execution, selection of colours, attention to detail and symbolism used. It stands out from Picasso‚Äôs other portraits simply because this shows a three-quarter body pose rather than the head only. This allowed him to truly portray how intense yet fragile his relationship with Dora Maar was.Word count: 922Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Email obituaries@thepost.co.nzWhen Francoise Gilot, who has died aged 101, first met Pablo Picasso one afternoon in May 1943 he spotted her at Le Catalan restaurant in Paris and brought her a bowl of cherries - he laughed when she told him that she was a painter, too.""That is the funniest thing I've heard all day,"" said the greying demigod of the art world. ""Girls who look like you can't be painters."" At 21, Gilot indeed exuded youth and a dark beauty, but the 62-year-old Picasso was also attracted by her unapologetic manner and her sharp, independent mind. .That a romance evolved owed more, Gilot later said, to World War II and the absence of any men her age than to any natural attraction to a man 40 years her senior. ""It was not a time like any other,"" she recalled. ""It was a time when everything was lost; a time of death. So: do I want to do something before I die or not? You have to seize it.""The relationship was never sentimental - she once described it as a ""catastrophe I didn't want to avoid"" - but it was creative and intellectually stimulating; Picasso encouraged her to study Cubism and his style permeated her paintings. Picasso, in turn, produced thousands of paintings and drawings of his young muse, often depicting her in cool blues and olive greens.During the 10-year relationship Picasso was emotionally and physically abusive. When Gilot once enjoyed a seaside trip without him, he afterwards held a lit cigarette to her right cheek, later painting the scar in his 1946 portrait of her, Femme au collier jaune. By way of apology he introduced her to one of her greatest inspirations, Matisse.In the late 1940s Gilot became restless and Picasso persuaded her that a child would settle her down. In 1947 she gave birth to a son, Claude, followed two years later by a daughter, Paloma, but she hated being pregnant and Picasso complained that their lives had become too staid.By the early 1950s his capricious moods and casual cruelty had become unbearable and he had taken other lovers. When, in September 1953, Gilot decided to leave him, Picasso set about alienating her from Paris's art world and tried to persuade dealers not to buy her work.""You imagine people will be interested in you?"" he told her. ""They won't ever, really, just for yourself. Even if you think people like you, it will only be a kind of curiosity they will have about a person whose life has touched mine so intimately.""Yet Gilot's paintings continued to sell. She viewed her break from Picasso as the beginning of her ""real life"" as a successful artist and went on to produce more than 6000 drawings, paintings and ceramics. ""I said watch out, because I came when I wanted to, but I will leave when I want,"" recalled Gilot, the only lover to have voluntarily left Picasso.She was born Marie Francoise Gilot in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a wealthy Parisian suburb, the only child of Emile Gilot, an agronomist and chemical manufacturer, and Madeleine (nee Renoult), a ceramicist and watercolour painter. Francoise was homeschooled until the age of 10, and though naturally left-handed, her father forced her to write with her right hand.Her early years were privileged but lonely, and in art she discovered a world ""in which I could express myself in a way that made sense to me"". Her mother taught her to paint and took her on regular trips to the Louvre. Her father, however, wanted her to become a lawyer.After the Germans invaded Paris she was briefly detained by French police for laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which commemorated the 1918 Armistice.In 1942 Gilot dropped out of law school and enrolled at an art school on the Left Bank. ""Officially"" she was her father's secretary and a fashion designer, a career the Germans considered politically benign, but she began secretly to paint under the tutelage of Endre Rozsda, the Hungarian-French surrealist. When her father found out he beat her and tried to have her committed to a psychiatric ward, and she moved in with her grandmother. After leaving Picasso and Paris in the 1950s she moved to America, where most of her collectors were based. In 1962 she divorced her first husband, Luc Simon, a French artist, and in California met Dr Jonas Salk, an American virologist who invented the first polio vaccine. When he proposed she initially refused, and he asked her to write down the reasons why. The list included: ""I can't live more than six months with one person"" and ""I'm not always in the mood to talk. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."" He found the list ""quite congenial"" and they were married in 1970. Salk died in 1995.Gilot's best-selling memoir, Life with Picasso (1964)caused a stir for its frank depiction of the irascible artist (who lost three lawsuits to stop its publication and then cut all ties with their children). Gilot never stopped painting. In 2021 she celebrated her 100th birthday with a solo exhibition in Hong Kong, and her 1965 painting Paloma a la Guitare, a portrait of her daughter, sold for US$1.3 million in an online auction. She never owned a Picasso. - The TimesCAPTION:Francoise Gilot at an exhibition of her work in Milan in 1965.

The work has several interpretations but is generally known as a plea against the fight.Or perhaps you're familiar with his melancholy painting ‚ÄúThe Old Guitarist‚Äù or a few facts about his life, legacy and work.When did Picasso die? Picasso died on April 8, 1973, at the age of 91. His cause of death was a pulmonary edema, or fluid in the lungs, The New York Times reported. According to his obituary, Picasso died at his villa in France in the company of his second wife Jacqueline Roque.Upon news of his death, crowds gathered outside Picasso paintings in the Museum of Modern Art. Several artists, political figures and historians shared tributes to The Times: ‚ÄúI consider him not only the greatest painter of the century but also one of the greatest of Spaniards,‚Äù former Spanish Foreign Minister Julio Alvarez Del Vayo shared with The New York Times. ‚ÄúHe was a great patriot, a defender of the rights of the Spanish people.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnlike most artists, age did not slacken his energy; he worked on uninterruptedly to the end. We are fortunate in having been witness to his presence in our time,‚Äù said Alfred H. Barr Jr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art and a Picasso scholar.Who was Picasso? Life and legacy Picasso was a Spanish artist often regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Born on Oct. 25, 1881, in Malaga, Spain, Picasso began studying art at a young age as the son of a drawing professor. He attended the Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1897 but had a more enjoyable time studying his surroundings than in the classroom.His work began gaining recognition after his first exhibit in Barcelona in 1900, and eventually appeared in the Spanish section of the Exposition Universelle in Paris, Britannica writes. It was on this months-long trip to Paris that Picasso first began experimenting in color, which would later become part of his signature style.Picasso‚Äôs work is often categorized into four periods. The first, the Blue Period, consisted of sober blue and green shades. The Rose Period contained a rosy palette of oranges and pinks and often included circus imagery. The African-influenced Period heavily referenced traditional African sculpture. And his work in Cubism involved abstract images of broken, analyzed and re-assembled objects.Picasso is regarded as the creator of Cubism. It led to some of his most beloved work. He began working closely with George Braque during this time, who helped him develop Analytical Cubism. ‚ÄúThe Cubist painters rejected the inherited concept that art should copy nature, or that artists should adopt the traditional techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening,‚Äù the Metropolitan Museum of Art writes. ‚ÄúThey wanted instead to emphasize the two-dimensionality of the canvas.‚Äù Lesser known than Picasso's work is his personal life, including his problematic treatment of women. He famously said women are either ""goddesses or doormats."" A 21-year-old Fran√ßoise Gilot met Picasso when he was 61. The two began a decade-long affair and had two children. Her memoir about their relationship serves as a portrait of a man ""who could be remarkably self-absorbed and cruel to those closest to him,"" The New York Times reports.One biography reports Picasso once enlisted his friend, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, to help him kidnap a woman he was in love with. Another woman recalls feeling ""fear"" on an occasion where Picasso lunged at her. Marina Picasso, his granddaughter, recalled his attitudes toward women in her memoir, ""Picasso, My Grandfather."" ""He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas,"" she wrote. ""After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them."" Picasso‚Äôs most famous paintings Picasso is thought to have made over 50,000 artworks in his lifetime, according to Britannica. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into some of his most well-known: Guernica: An anti-war symbol, this painting was completed in 1937 as a reaction to the Nazi bombing of the Spanish Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. Weeping Woman: This painting of a crying woman was another Spanish Civil War era work. Guernica contains an image of a woman carrying her dead child, which Picasso built ‚ÄúWeeping Woman‚Äù from. According to Tate art museum, the figure is based on French photographer Dora Maar, who was Picasso‚Äôs lover and muse for a period. Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon: This painting, influenced by Iberian and African art, depicts five naked women. The title of the painting is an homage to a street in Barcelona known for brothels. This painting caused a stir of controversy, as other artists and onlookers were outraged at the taboo design of female bodies and faces.The Old Guitarist: Picasso crafted this painting of a blind musician in his ‚ÄúBlue Period,‚Äù during which he stuck to ‚Äúcold, monochromatic blue palette, flattened forms, and emotional, psychological themes of human misery and alienation,‚Äù according to the Art Institute of Chicago.

The large oil painting that the Spanish artist painted in 1937 now hangs in the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, Spain and sticks out like a sore thumb. Not just for its vastness but also for the imagery shown in it, it is impossible to take your eyes off it. Only when you see it in person do you realise how powerful this anti-war painting is. It is 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) across in size and portrays the suffering brought by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, a screaming woman, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames. While it is clear Picasso wanted to protest against the nature of war, why did he choose to paint this and is it his best work?Story behind the artWhen one thinks of Picasso, one thinks of cubism and his love for women and animals. One also thinks of the different periods he chose to paint using certain colours or objects. And then comes Guernica which has its own category ‚Äì war. Picasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26th April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country town in northern Spain. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy ruthlessly bombed the town at the request of Spanish Nationalists. Picasso wanted to bring the world‚Äôs attention to the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War and what better way to do it than through artwork? This painting was exhibited at the Spanish display at the 1937 Paris International Exposition, and at other venues around the world which helped raise funds for Spanish War relief.When you look at the painting, it seems as if Picasso was so passionate about what he was painting when in reality it took him time to get to that point of intensity. He worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April on the initial sketches. And then everything changed when he heard about the 26 April bombing of Guernica. His friend and poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso and urged him to make the bombing his subject. American artist John Ferren then assisted him in preparing the canvas and his mistress Dora Maar documented its creation as an experienced photographer. It is this documentation that would act as a publicity tool for the painting as Picasso rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work. Guernica was an exception and it is said that he admitted influential visitors to observe his progress on the painting. While talking about his painting, he said ‚ÄúI clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death.‚ÄùSymbolism and its significanceIt took Picasso 35 days to finish this masterpiece. He chose to paint this using matte house paint to avoid the glossy effect paintings have. I had never seen a black and white painting before that was so impactful. The symbolism and the images shown shocked me as well. You see a wide-eyed bull on the left with a tail suggesting rising flame and smoke as seen through a window standing over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. Once you overcome what you have seen on the left side, you are faced with a falling horse who is in agony in the centre of the painting with a large gaping hole in its side. A dead and dismembered body of a soldier is seen lying under the horse. These are just some of the symbolism of war that you get to see in the painting. It is full of devastation, pain and agony and the painting moves you. You cannot help but be both horrified and fascinated by the images Picasso has so carefully painted on the canvas. However, the interpretation just like in an artwork defers on the viewer. For example, the interpretation of the two main images in the painting ‚Äì bull and horse has varied for critics and historians alike. According to Art historian Patricia Failing, the bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture and Picasso used these characters to play many different roles over time.¬† Ironically, when the Cubism master himself was asked about the meaning of the bull and the horse, he said ‚Äú‚Ä¶this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse‚Ä¶ If you give meaning to certain things in my paintings it may be very true, but it is not my idea to give this meaning.‚ÄùThe relevance and importance of the painting can be seen in the symbolism. I consider Guernica to be an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa of our time, and Picasso‚Äôs best work to date. And as Leonardo da Vinci spurred a Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Guernica should be seen as Picasso‚Äôs comment on what war can do and how art can protect us against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death. These topics are still relevant to us and will continue to be till the concept of war exists.Next up in Behind the Art: Why is The Milkmaid by Johannes Vermeer famous?Word count: 897Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Also the pioneer of the art of assemblage, the Spanish artist‚Äôs constantly changing oeuvre continues to be deconstructed even as his works fetch record prices at auctions worldwide.On his 50th death anniversary today (April 8), we look at his enduring legacy and profound influence.Early LifeBorn in Malaga, Spain, in 1881, Picasso‚Äôs talent for art was recognised early by his father Don Jose Ruiz y Blasco, an artist himself, and Pablo‚Äôs first art teacher. His mother reportedly claimed that the young Picasso‚Äôs first word was ‚Äúpiz‚Äù, short for ‚Äúlapiz‚Äù, meaning pencil in Spanish and the child prodigy completed his earliest painting, Picador, when he was only eight.At 13, he enrolled in an advanced class at Barcelona‚Äôs School of Fine Arts after he completed its complex entrance exam ‚Äì which usually took one month ‚Äì in just a week. Admitted to Madrid‚Äôs leading art school, Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, three years later, he found the school‚Äôs focus on classical subjects and techniques frustrating, and soon moved back to Barcelona, where he began frequenting the popular Els Quatre Gats (‚ÄúThe Four Cats‚Äù) cafe. There, he developed his first artistic friendships with the likes of Manuel Pallares, Carlos Casagemas, Josep Cardona and Jaume Sabart√©s, among others.By the turn of the century, he was in Paris, in the country which would become his home till his demise in 1973.Picasso prior to cubismIn a career that lasted over 75 years, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, Picasso created over 13,500 paintings and designs, 1,00,000 prints and engravings, 34,000 book illustrations, and 300 sculptures and ceramics. One of the most prolific modernists, he was constantly innovating, with his work reflecting his preoccupying thoughts at the time.Human miseries and social alienation he saw in the early 1900s, apart from death of fellow artist-friend Carles Casagemas, led him to paint in melancholic blue from 1901 to 1904, in what is now recognised as the Blue Period. The friendships he developed subsequently, including a relationship with French artist and model Fernande Olivier, was represented by a palette of reds, browns, oranges and yellows, that defined the Rose Period (1904-1906), with depiction of harlequins, acrobats and circus performers.This is also the period when he found a patron in American novelist and art collector Gertrude Stein, whom he painted a portrait of in 1905.The birth of cubism and thereafterRepresenting realities and subjects in fragments and deconstructed forms, allowing for viewing from multiple angles, Cubism as a revolutionary new approach was invented around 1907-08 by Picasso and French painter Georges Braque, influenced, among others, by the late work of Paul Cezanne, African and Iberian sculptures, and with a desire to reject the accepted norms of representation. Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon (1907) ‚Äî with five nude women, two of them wearing African masks ‚Äî is largely considered one of Piccaso‚Äôs earliest paintings hinting at cubism. Still Life with Chair Caning (1912), meanwhile, is celebrated for being modern art‚Äôs first collage.After the World War, at a time when artists across Europe called for ‚Äòle rappel √† l‚Äôordre‚Äò or ‚Äòthe return to order‚Äô, seeking a revival of the arts of antiquity and classical traditions, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. There he adopted a new classical approach, that soon moved to surrealism that emphasised on depicting images from within one‚Äôs unconscious mind.His oeuvre in the subsequent years blended his several influences and saw experiments with varied media, from sculptures to copperplate etchings and ceramics. In 1937, he painted Guernica, one of his largest works, measuring 11 feet tall and 25 feet wide, considered now to be one of the greatest anti-war paintings. Made in response to the bombing of the Basque town Guernica in April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, it reportedly took Picasso one month to paint and was the highlight of the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition that year.Picasso as a poet and playwrightPicasso‚Äôs experiments were as wide-ranging as his influences. The Spanish artist is known to have harboured a keen interest in dramatic arts, and 1916 onwards he collaborated with Paris-based company Ballets Russes for set designs and costumes. This is also where he met his first wife Olga Khokhlova, who was a dancer in the company. He worked on several productions in the 1920s, and in 1946, he did the curtain design for Roland Petit‚Äôs Le Rendez-vous at the Ballets des Champs-√âlys√©es.The 1940s also saw him pen two full-length surrealist plays, Desire Caught by the Tail and The Four Little Girls. His legacy also includes over 300 poems that he began to write much later in life, after the end of his first marriage in 1935.When Picasso was accused of stealing Mona LisaNot protected with as much security that it garners today as one of the world‚Äôs most recognised paintings, Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre Museum in Paris 1911, and Picasso was one of the suspects. The theft was traced to him after Honore-Joseph G√©ry Pieret, secretary of his close associate, poet and writer Guillaume Apollinaire, entered a newspaper office in Paris and confessed that he had stolen artworks for the two in the past.Soon it became clear that Mona Lisa wasn‚Äôt one of them, and Apollinaire and Picasso were finally completely absolved in 1913, when Vincenzo Peruggia, who was trying to sell the painting to an Italian art dealer, was caught for the theft.Incidentally, as one of the world‚Äôs most prolific artists, Picasso himself has the world‚Äôs most stolen or missing artwork or in dispute. According to My Modern Met website, in 2012, the Art Loss Register listed 1,147 stolen works by Picasso.Word count: 977Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

One is often fortunate enough to carry home some items from the workplace which would otherwise be wasted ‚Äî food, for example, or books or stationery. But Merrill Rummel surely did not expect to find a painting by Pablo Picasso when he unpacked the carton he had been told to take home from his workplace at the loading dock of Logan International Airport in Boston. He later returned it, but one wonders what would have happened had he just thrown away the carton as trash. This shows that good things come to those who do not waste.Adrita Bose, CalcuttaPower gamesSir ‚Äî The coming together of leaders from some 20 Opposition parties on a common platform in Patna is a significant development (‚ÄúLessons from Brigade‚Äù, June 23). The parties face an uphill task to stop the saffron juggernaut, but they should focus on avoiding a split in the non-Hindutva votes by fielding a candidate from the united Opposition in seats where they have a likelihood of winning. This means that the Congress must allow regional parties to take the upper hand in areas where they are stronger. The Bharatiya Janata Party must be defeated if the founding fathers‚Äô vision of an inclusive India is to be preserved.G. David Milton, Maruthancode, Tamil NaduSir ‚Äî In all probability, the vendetta politics of the Centre, Hindu-Muslim polarisation, and the necessity of projecting a united Opposition were the key topics of discussion at the Opposition meet in Patna. A number of Opposition parties agreed to join the meeting organised and hosted by the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar. Unity is the need of the hour. Regional leaders must set aside their differences in order to dethrone the BJP.Jahangir Ali, MumbaiSir ‚Äî It is disheartening that the chief minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, made his participation in the united Opposition conditional on unanimous support for his party‚Äôs stance against the Centre‚Äôs ordinance on the control of administrative services in Delhi (‚ÄúA test of sacrifice‚Äù, June 23). The meeting in Patna was meant to chalk out a strategy to take on the BJP. Kejriwal has fallen for the Centre‚Äôs trick of driving a wedge in the Opposition.Bhagwan Thadani, MumbaiPorous borderSir ‚Äî West Bengal shares a porous border with neighbouring Bangladesh, making it vulnerable to illegal migration. The unchecked influx of Bangladeshi and Rohingya Muslims has raised concerns in some circles. The issue of illegal migration has become highly politicised in Bengal, with parties using it to consolidate their support bases. Since measures to identify illegal immigrants, such as the National Register of Citizens, have faced criticism, political parties should come together and devise a method to solve this contentious issue.Raja Bagchi, RanchiUnstable regionSir ‚Äî There can be no denying that the Middle East has been chaotic for a long time. Civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen along with feeble governments in Iraq and Lebanon have presented challenges to lasting peace. It is unfortunate that economic unrest and sectarianism have plagued these former colonies of European powers who left without putting in place stable systems of governance.Arka Goswami,West BurdwanParting shotSir ‚Äî It was alarming to read reports of several vehicles being vandalised by a gang of hooligans in Pune‚Äôs Taljai Vasahat and Karve Nagar.

I have seen what could be and asked why not.‚ÄùThis is a famous quote by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, who always sought to look at art through a different lens. He painted Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon in 1907, not knowing it would forever change the course of the art world. The painting, which is 8 feet long and 7 feet wide, depicts five naked women created from flat, jagged planes, their faces inspired by African masks and Iberian sculpture. This masterpiece gave birth to modern art and was the precursor to the style that became known as ‚ÄòCubism‚Äô. The painting currently hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, New York City and has an estimated worth of about $1.2 billion. What is the significance of this artwork and why was it so controversial in its time?The story behind the artBefore Picasso started working on this grand masterpiece, he was going through what art critics now call the ‚Äòblue period‚Äô. The term refers to the period when Picasso only used the colour blue in various shades to paint anything and everything. His agent struggled to sell his paintings but Picasso refused to touch any other colour between 1901 and 1904. When he did decide to finally look at other colours on a palette, he wanted to change the face of Western art. He started working on Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon and this was a signal to the world that Cubism is coming and will be here to stay. He drew the first designs for Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon in the winter of 1906-1907. The earliest sketches of this painting featured two men inside the brothel ‚Äî a sailor and a medical student. It took Picasso hundreds of sketches and nine months to complete the painting on the canvas.Originally titled The Brothel of Avignon, this painting refers to a street in Barcelona called Carrer d‚ÄôAviny√≥, which was famous for its many brothels. Picasso looked at the notion of beauty unconventionally. He chose to not showcase the beauty of a woman as traditional European paintings did. The five figures shown in the painting are prostitutes who boldly stare back at the viewer. Their faces are painted using sharp geometric shapes and they appear slightly menacing along with their disjointed body shapes. The woman on the left has an Egyptian-style dress and facial features. Picasso was highly influenced by African art and masks and thus, used that as a reference.Controversy and impactThe world was not ready for Picasso‚Äôs new masterpiece. When the artist unveiled the painting in his studio, it remained there for quite some time and it was not well-liked. Only his intimate circle of friends, artists and dealers were allowed to see it. Matisse considered the work to be a ‚Äòbad joke‚Äô. He believed Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon undermined and mocked modern art. Despite his criticism, he borrowed aspects of this painting for his famous work Bathers with a Turtle. Most of Picasso‚Äôs friends were shocked by the obscenity of the painting. Undeterred by the reaction of his peers, he exhibited the painting for the first time in 1916 at the Salon d‚ÄôAntin. The public deemed it to be immoral and the title of the painting had to be changed to Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon from The Brothel of Avignon.Picasso never liked this title and often referred to the painting as ‚ÄòMy Brothel‚Äô. Despite the widespread anger towards the painting, some art lovers did offer to buy it, but Picasso refused. He kept the painting with him till 1924 until his friends urged him to sell it to the designer Jacques Doucet for around 25,000 francs. Picasso however, did not need to sell anything by that time. He, after all, was one of the most famous artists at the time and could easily sell anything for a much higher price. The reason why he sold the painting for a lower price to Doucet was because Doucet promised he would hang the painting in the Louvre Museum, Paris. Before dying, however, Doucet never mentioned it in his will and chose to sell the painting to private collectors. In 1937, New York City‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art bought it for $24,000.Just like any change, this painting, too, took time to warm up to art lovers across the world. The art world did not begin to embrace the painting until early in the 1920s, when Andre Breton republished the photo in an article entitled, ‚ÄòThe Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves.‚Äô Picasso would have never thought many would start studying this masterpiece to learn about the development of the Cubism movement and how modern art can depict a scene in several ways. He showcases how to grab the attention of the viewers and force them to look at the woman and their intense gazes. Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon is an important piece of artwork in the history of Western Art. Pablo Picasso, along with Georges Braque, greatly shifted the way art had been moving and progressing, to new and interesting forms.Picasso opened the doors for artists to explore different styles to express themselves, and this alone is the biggest gift for any artist.Next Up in Behind the Art: Why is Portrait of Dr Gachet considered one of Van Gogh‚Äôs best works?

Made using oil on canvas, this painting is huge and measures 48 3/8 x 32 1/2 inches, roughly four by 2 2/3 feet. It is also notable for the ghostly presence of a mysterious image painted underneath. Currently gracing the walls of the Art Institute of Chicago, USA, it is worth more than $100,000,000. It is safe to say that The Old Guitarist is a priceless piece of art by the master of Cubism and Surrealism, but what is the real story behind the art? What is the mysterious image painted underneath?When Picasso started working on this grand masterpiece, he was going through what art critics now call the 'Blue period'. The term refers to the period when Picasso only used the colour blue in various shades as well as greys and blacks to paint anything and everything. His agent struggled to sell his paintings but he refused to touch any other colour between 1901 and 1904. The Old Guitarist was painted in 1903, just after the suicide death of Picasso's close friend Casagemas. Carles Antoni Cosme Damia Casagemas I Coll was a Spanish painter and poet who committed suicide in a Paris cafe, during a farewell dinner party he held for himself. This incident remained with Picasso for life and he dedicated several paintings to his friend. At the same time, the artist was nearly penniless and knew how it was like to be impoverished. He felt excluded from society and was sympathetic to the plight of those cast out of society such as the poor, prostitutes and the ill. Thus, Picasso chose to use the colour blue to communicate the pain and desolation that he was feeling at the time. During the 'Blue Period', he continued to feature outcasts as the subject matter of his paintings. He also included subjects that were considered exiles and recluses, such as drunkards, the homeless, and of course, individuals that were struggling to keep up with the pressures of day-to-day life.The Old Guitarist was made during the peak of Picasso's 'Blue Period' in Madrid Spain. Also known as 'The Blind Guitarist', it shows a skinny old man whose bones are visible. He can be seen latching on to his guitar despite his weak state. His skin is pale blue and his clothes are torn. His sad state is further highlighted by his blindness, the isolation, and the atmosphere which surrounds him. The man's guitar is painted using brown - a colour that represents hope in Picasso's mind. He wanted to showcase how the guitar is the only hope for survival for the man in the painting and how dependent he is on it.Although Picasso is clearly showing the world how lower-class societies suffer every day, some believe that he used the old man as the subject of his artwork to represent the isolation that most artists observe. Society often isolates artists even though it is art and culture that brings together people. This represents Picasso's criticism of society as well as the reality of human existence.During his 'Blue Period', Picasso covered sketches on canvases possibly due to poverty and not enough canvases available on hand. The Old Guitarist has intrigued researchers for a long time because of the sketches hidden behind the main figure in the painting. Recent x-rays by curators found three figures behind the guitarist's body. The three figures are a young mother with a small child kneeling by her side and an animal on the right side of the canvas; an old woman with her head bent forward. The young mother in the painting has long dark hair and a thoughtful expression. No one to date knows why he chose to not complete those sketches and instead painted The Old Guitarist. However, this is not an uncommon practice. Artists tend to change their minds about their subjects all the time and Picasso was known to paint subjects that emotionally moved him. It is speculated that he may have drawn upon George Frederic Watts's 1886 painting of Hope, which also depicts a hunched, helpless musician with a distorted angular form using a blue tone.Picasso's 'Blue Period' began with the painting Casagemas in His Coffin, which was a painting showing his friend lying in a coffin after he committed suicide. After that, he made several paintings that showed despair and sorrow, all of which are scattered around the world. The Old Guitarist, however, remains to be the most popular piece of artwork. The Art Institute of Chicago acquired the piece in 1926 in what turned out to be a pivotal moment for the artist. The Old Guitarist became Picasso's first painting to be acquired by an American museum and it was also the first Picasso painting that any museum in the world acquired for its permanent collection.?Over time, the painting has influenced several artists of all backgrounds. Paul McCartney drew from the painting when creating a chord progression. It is this progression and McCartney's accompanying melody that became his contributions to the 2015 Kanye West song ""All Day""Art critics could write endless books on why The Old Guitarist is so iconic even now. However, even those who hold no knowledge of art truly appreciate this piece due to the use of melancholy colours and the bony structure of a man who is latching on to his guitar.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Times.Word count: 942Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Although he was considered the most influential artist of the 20th century - and the top-seller, too, with his painting, Les Femmes d'Alger, selling for a record $179.4m (‚Ç¨163m) - dealers now say the Picasso market is about to decline. The Spaniard, who is considered the ""gold standard"" in modern painting, is beginning to appear out of kilter with the times.Younger artists have turned against him, according to art expert Ben Luke, and his private life has come under censure.A major exhibition in Brooklyn this June, staged by feminist Hannah Gadsby, will question Picasso's links to ""misogyny and masculinity"". His frequent cheating on his wives and fathering children by different women are no longer admired as excusable macho behaviour. He seduced one of his mistresses, Marie-Therese Walter, when she was 17 (he was 45) In a portrait, he placed an image of an erect penis in her left cheek.His best-known lover, Fran√ßoise Gilot, now 101 and an accomplished painter herself, has said Picasso was the ultimate male chauvinist to whom nobody ever said no. (She had two children with him, and they claimed he ignored them.) He was, she said, utterly selfish.In France, where Picasso lived (until he died in 1973, aged 91) his treatment of women would then have been excused as ""temp√©rament d'artiste"", yet the truth is that great artists, writers and musicians are not always nice people. Patricia Highsmith, the American thriller writer, was described by her own publisher as ""a mean, cruel, hard, unlovable and unloving human being"", she ""stole rich, classy blondes"" from their husbands, and then dumped them; and a vile racist. She made appalling remarks about the Holocaust. She also disliked black people, and was averse to Latinos, Koreans, Indians and Christians.And yet, Highsmith is revered as an amazing writer: her novel The Talented Mr Ripley has been filmed five times, and a new screen version with Andrew Scott, will be on Netflix later this year. And there's a cinema documentary currently screening called Loving Highsmith.Bad behaviour is not in short supply among geniuses and people of towering talent. Lucien Freud was another artist to whom it seems ""no one ever said no"". Although involved in a homosexual love-triangle in his twenties, he went on to father 14 acknowledged children by different lovers; it's been suggested the true number could be more than 40.Eric Gill, the sculptor, whose stunning work adorns the BBC's Broadcasting House in London - and several Oxford colleges - sexually abused his daughters and his sister. There's an ongoing debate as to whether Gill's work should be removed.In Lourdes, currently, there's also a debate as to whether the mosaics of Father Marko Rupnik should be removed from the pilgrimage site (and from churches globally). His mosaics of The Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary were added to the Basilica's facade in 2008, but he has recently been suspended from ministry because of accusations of sexually and psychologically abusing women.How to separate the man - or woman - from the work has been debated for some time. It was sometimes dubbed ""The Wagner Question"", when it became known that Richard Wagner was idolised by Hitler (and Wagner himself had been a poisonous anti-Semite). Should he be banned? Despite his odious views, some musicians have concluded not, while others have been adamant that he should.The debate has become more pertinent today, when the personal failings of renowned individuals are more exposed by modern media.Moreover, when it comes to misogyny, women now are less tolerant of giving a moral pass to someone like Picasso, simply because he was a great artist.And yet, Fran√ßoise Gilot herself says that sometimes a great artist must have a great ego - he has to be ""100 times more selfish"" than others, because he must see himself as ""100 times greater"".In normal life, we call that ""entitlement"", but the genius thinks of himself as justifiably entitled.Watch the prices in the Picasso market just the same.CREDIT: Mary KennyCAPTION: Selfish: Spanish artist Pablo Picasso has been described as the ultimate male chauvinist to whom nobody ever said no.

What is the story behind this painting and why is it so significant?Le R√™ve, also known as The Dream, is one of the most expensive paintings ever sold by Pablo Picasso. The painting was sold privately for $155 million on March 26, 2013, and is known for its contrasted colours and oversimplified outlines as it belongs to Picasso‚Äôs period of distorted depictions. Made in 1932 using oil on canvas, Picasso then 50 years old, portrayed his 22-year-old mistress Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter. Critics have pointed out that Picasso painted an erect penis, presumably to represent his own, in the upturned face of his model, highlighting the painting‚Äôs erotic content. But what is the story behind this painting and why is it so significant?Story Behind the ArtEveryone by now is aware of the troubled relationship between Pablo Picasso and his muse Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter but what came out of their affair were several masterpieces by the Spanish artist. Walter was almost 30 years Picasso‚Äôs junior when they first met in 1927. Before Walter became pregnant and the affair was discovered by Picasso‚Äôs wife, Olga, the artist and his muse engaged in a covert affair for more than eight years. Picasso was also having an affair with Dora Maar at the time. The artist suggested that the two of his muses compete for his love. Until the beginning of the 1940s, Walter continued to collaborate with Picasso. The painting of Marie-Th√©r√®se that Picasso called ‚ÄúLe R√™ve‚Äù is from the time when he painted distorted depictions of his subjects using contrasted colours and simple, clean outlines. In 1941, it was first sold for $7,000, and in 1997, at an auction hosted by Christie‚Äôs, it was purchased for $48.4 million.What does the painting represent?According to several critics, the upturned face of this portrait suggests that the artist is creating an abstract version of his penis. This kind of abstract eroticism can be seen in Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs and many other well-known 20th-century paintings. The Dream was finished just two weeks before Marie-Th√©r√®se showed up in Reading. She is shown in asleep in an armchair. The colour scheme used here, which Picasso used in a lot of his work around this time, gives the impression of sensuality. The composition was completed with strong lines and soft pastel colours, which exuded a contemporary vibe. The sharp lines he uses to show her fingers and the fine detail in the background will make some people think of Henri Matisse‚Äôs Music and The Dance paintings. As the young lady sleeps, the revealing pose suggests sexuality and vulnerability. Here, Picasso faithfully depicts her renowned long blonde hair by using yellow to contrast aggressively with the darker background. Her beaded necklace, which is delicately balanced on her meditative chest, then repeats the hues of red and yellow. Perhaps this scene reveals the young woman‚Äôs hair, curved figure, and undeniable beauty, which attracted her elderly lover the most. The domestic setting of this scene should suggest comfort and privacy, a private moment between these two passionate lovers. Although many people consider this to be a cubist piece, it can be argued that it was part of his surrealist period, and the colour scheme suggests fauvism. Picasso was breaking new ground in art history at this time, necessitating new classifications because of his distinctive ideas and styles that produced art in previously unheard-of ways.Controversy and Wynn incidentNo famous painting is complete without a little bit of controversy. Controversies help garner talk about the artist and his work and help the artworks stay alive centuries later. The fact that Picasso has depicted an erect penis over the face of a woman has caused a little controversy over time. It is common for artists to include hidden messages, concepts, or designs in their paintings, and the painting‚Äôs apparent similarity encourages critics to believe that Picasso drew his penis. This could represent sex itself or the model‚Äôs possession or influence by the artist.And then there is the Wynn incident. A six-inch tear in the middle of the left side of the painting was caused by one of the previous owners striking his elbow on the canvas. Due to the owner‚Äôs name, the incident was dubbed the Wynn incident, and it also significantly decreased the value of the painting itself. Wynn had announced to a group of his friends in October 2006 that he had agreed to sell Le R√™ve to Steve Cohen for $139 million and then according to sources, Wynn put his right elbow through the canvas while he was showing the painting to his friends, presumably about to reveal the now officially undisclosed previous owner. After a $90,000 repair, the painting was re-valued at $85 million, as Wynn later stated that he took the event as a warning not to sell it.However, the painting‚Äôs legacy and controversy are so great that even though the tear was patched up later, people still considered it valuable and the painting was purchased by SAC Capital‚Äôs Steven A. Cohen for $155 million, according to the New York Post on March 26, 2013.Word count: 863Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Why did Picasso choose to paint this? Is it worth $104 million?Pablo Picasso painted his fifth highest-selling painting Gar√ßon √† la pipe (Boy with a Pipe) when he was 24 years old in 1905. This masterpiece was created during his Rose Period, soon after he settled in the Montmartre section of Paris, France. This oil on canvas painting depicts a Parisian boy holding a pipe in his left hand and wearing a garland or wreath of flowers. The artwork is listed as one of the most expensive paintings, after being sold at Sotheby‚Äôs auction for $104 million on 5 May 2004 and is currently a part of a private collection. Why did Picasso choose to paint this? Is it worth $104 million?Story behind the art and the boy with a pipePicasso was not always so well known and liked during his initial years of being an artist. In 1905 at the age of 24, he was still a struggling artist who was living in poverty in a dilapidated artist building n Montmartre in Paris. He had recently moved on from his Blue Period in which he only painted using blue and green hues. He was now in a new and more optimistic phase known as his Rose period. He wanted to use more colours other than blue on the canvas and his subject for this painting was a local boy named P‚Äôtit Louis who died at a young age. Very little is known about the boy and his background. According to a variety of sources, the boy was a model in his teen years who hung around Picasso‚Äôs studio and volunteered to pose for the oil work. Picasso‚Äôs comments about the boy were that he was one of the ‚Äúlocal types, actors, ladies, gentlemen, delinquents‚Ä¶ He stayed there, sometimes the whole day. He watched me work. He loved that. ‚Äù It was clear that either Picasso did not want the world to know who the boy was or he did not know the boy himself. However, as an artist, he spent a lot of time deciding on the position in which he wanted to paint the boy. After much repositioning of the model, Picasso decided to go with the boy sitting down, holding a pipe. The boy is dressed in blue overalls and wears a garland of roses on his head. Andr√© Salmon, a friend of Picasso, described in 1912 how he had altered what was originally a study of life into the current artwork in a sudden flash of inspiration by adding the flowers.‚ÄùOne night, Picasso abandoned the company of his friends and their intellectual chit-chat. He returned to his studio, took the canvas he had abandoned a month before and crowned the figure of the little apprentice lad with roses. He had made this work a masterpiece thanks to a sublime whim.‚ÄùPicasso‚Äôs rendering of ‚ÄúP‚Äôtit Louis‚Äù also has elements of classical art. He was inspired by the work of the French Neoclassical painter Ingres. Like Picasso‚Äôs Young Girl with a Flower Basket, which was painted in the same year, Gar√ßon √† la Pipe conveys conflicting imagery of innocence and experience. Picasso described the boy as an ‚Äúevil angel‚Äù. In this painting, the boy wears a garland of roses on his head to symbolise the blood of the Eucharist, a reference to the transition from youth to maturity. Picasso also depicts the contrast between the harsh street life that Louis endured and the innocence of his youth.Criticism and impact on popular cultureThe painting was first bought by John Hay Whitney in 1950 for $30,000 and then on May 5, 2004, the painting was sold for US$104,168,000 at Sotheby‚Äôs auction in New York City. Sotheby‚Äôs did not reveal the name of the buyer though sources say that it was Guido Barilla, owner of the Barilla Group. At the time, it broke the record for the amount paid for an auctioned painting. The jaw-dropping price of the painting made several art historians question its worth. Many art critics have stated that the high sale price of Gar√ßon √† la pipe has much more to do with the artist‚Äôs name than with the merit or historical importance of the painting. According to news reports, Picasso expert Pepe Karmel, reached New York the morning after the sale and was stunned to hear about the price. He was quoted to say ‚Äúthat a pleasant, minor painting could command a price appropriate to a real masterwork by Picasso. This just shows how much the marketplace is divorced from the true values of art.‚Äù However, some genuinely appreciate this painting and say it celebrates images of adolescent beauty and is one of the most beautiful paintings of Picasso‚Äôs Rose Period.Whether Picasso wanted to merely practice portrait painting or change the landscape of modern art, as a 24-year-old poor artist he would have never thought his painting would sell for such a high price. The painting‚Äôs worth not only shocked art critics but also sent shock waves through the entertainment industry. Calvin Harris‚Äô 2017 song ‚ÄúSlide‚Äù contains the lyrics ‚ÄúI might empty my bank account and buy that boy with a pipe‚Äù. Vocalist Frank Ocean explained that it is an allusion to, ‚Äúa Picasso painting that sold for so much money‚Äù. It is quite evident that regardless of the historical importance and relevance of the painting, owning a Picasso painting is a status symbol of its own.Next up in Behind the Art: What is the significance of Picasso‚Äôs Dora Maar au Chat which is currently the sixth highest-selling painting by the artist?Word count: 948Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The artist painted this masterpiece during 1903-1904, a period during which he was going through emotional turmoil and poverty. Made using oil on canvas, this painting is huge and measures 48 3/8 x 32 1/2 inches, roughly four by 2 2/3 feet. It is also notable for the ghostly presence of a mysterious image painted underneath. Currently gracing the walls of the Art Institute of Chicago, USA, it is worth more than $100,000,000. It is safe to say that The Old Guitarist is a priceless piece of art by the master of Cubism and Surrealism, but what is the real story behind the art? What is the mysterious image painted underneath?Picasso‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlue Period‚Äô and the paintingWhen Picasso started working on this grand masterpiece, he was going through what art critics now call the ‚ÄòBlue period‚Äô. The term refers to the period when Picasso only used the colour blue in various shades as well as greys and blacks to paint anything and everything. His agent struggled to sell his paintings but he refused to touch any other colour between 1901 and 1904. The Old Guitarist was painted in 1903, just after the suicide death of Picasso‚Äôs close friend Casagemas. Carles Antoni Cosme Dami√† Casagemas I Coll was a Spanish painter and poet who committed suicide in a Paris cafe, during a farewell dinner party he held for himself. This incident remained with Picasso for life and he dedicated several paintings to his friend. At the same time, the artist was nearly penniless and knew how it was like to be impoverished. He felt excluded from society and was sympathetic to the plight of those cast out of society such as the poor, prostitutes, and the ill. Thus, Picasso chose to use the colour blue to communicate the pain and desolation that he was feeling at the time. During the ‚ÄòBlue Period‚Äô, he continued to feature outcasts as the subject matter of his paintings. He also included subjects that were considered exiles and recluses, such as drunkards, the homeless, and of course, individuals that were struggling to keep up with the pressures of day-to-day life.The Old Guitarist was made during the peak of Picasso‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlue Period‚Äô in Madrid Spain. Also known as ‚ÄòThe Blind Guitarist‚Äô, it shows a skinny old man whose bones are visible. He can be seen latching on to his guitar despite his weak state. His skin is pale blue and his clothes are torn. His sad state is further highlighted by his blindness, the isolation, and the atmosphere which surrounds him. The man‚Äôs guitar is painted using brown ‚Äì a colour that represents hope in Picasso‚Äôs mind. He wanted to showcase how the guitar is the only hope for survival for the man in the painting and how dependent he is on it.Although Picasso is clearly showing the world how lower-class societies suffer every day, some believe that he used the old man as the subject of his artwork to represent the isolation that most artists observe. Society often isolates artists even though it is art and culture that brings together people. This represents Picasso‚Äôs criticism of society as well as the reality of human existence.Mysterious images underneath The Old GuitaristDuring his ‚ÄòBlue Period‚Äô, Picasso covered sketches on canvases possibly due to poverty and not enough canvases available on hand. The Old Guitarist has intrigued researchers for a long time because of the sketches hidden behind the main figure in the painting. Recent x-rays by curators found three figures behind the guitarist‚Äôs body. The three figures are a young mother with a small child kneeling by her side and an animal on the right side of the canvas; an old woman with her head bent forward. The young mother in the painting has long dark hair and a thoughtful expression. No one to date knows why he chose to not complete those sketches and instead painted The Old Guitarist. However, this is not an uncommon practice. Artists tend to change their minds about their subjects all the time and Picasso was known to paint subjects that emotionally moved him. It is speculated that he may have drawn upon George Frederic Watts‚Äôs 1886 painting of Hope, which also depicts a hunched, helpless musician with a distorted angular form using a blue tone.Popularity and impact on Modern CulturePicasso‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlue Period‚Äô began with the painting Casagemas in His Coffin, which was a painting showing his friend lying in a coffin after he committed suicide. After that, he made several paintings that showed despair and sorrow, all of which are scattered around the world. The Old Guitarist, however, remains to be the most popular piece of artwork. The Art Institute of Chicago acquired the piece in 1926 in what turned out to be a pivotal moment for the artist. The Old Guitarist became Picasso‚Äôs first painting to be acquired by an American museum and it was also the first Picasso painting that any museum in the world acquired for its permanent collection. Over time, the painting has influenced several artists of all backgrounds. Paul McCartney drew from the painting when creating a chord progression. It is this progression and McCartney‚Äôs accompanying melody that became his contributions to the 2015 Kanye West song ‚ÄúAll Day‚ÄùArt critics could write endless books on why The Old Guitarist is so iconic even now. However, even those who hold no knowledge of art truly appreciate this piece due to the use of melancholy colours and the bony structure of a man who is latching on to his guitar.Next Up in Behind the Art: How did Gustav Klimt‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄúKiss‚Äù spark a sexual revolution in art?

A $31 million Willem de Kooning. A $35 million Francis Bacon. Anyone worried that the art market might plummet following recent bank failures and broader economic uncertainty can exhale‚Äîfor now.On Thursday, Christie's kicked off New York's spring sale series with a $178 million sale of art from the estate of the late Cond√© Nast chairman Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. Of the 16 pieces in the cache, seven works crossed the $10 million mark. Christie's performance suggests that collectors still feel safe splurging on art trophies vouched for by a tastemaker like Newhouse, who went by Si.Christie's knew it had a hard act to follow after last fall's historic $1.6 billion estate sale of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , so it sought out another name with similar collector heft and a proven record of drawing bids. Thursday marked the third time Mr. Newhouse's estate has plied pieces into sales since he died six years ago at age 89‚Äîa strategy of trickling artworks onto the marketplace rather than seeking to unload them all at once. The latest batch was expected to sell for between $142 million and $202 million.A 1947 Willem de Kooning, ""Orestes,"" that Mr. Newhouse won for $13.2 million in 2002 resold for $31 million. It was estimated to sell for at least $25 million. Christie's bumped up its estimate for Bacon's 1969 ""Self Portrait"" from $20 million to $22 million ahead of the sale and sold for $35 million. The media mogul paid $8.9 million for the portrait in 2006.A trio of Jasper Johns works in the estate underperformed. The artist's 1971 ""Decoy,"" a graphic overlay of some of his best-known motifs, sold for $10.7 million. It was estimated to sell for at least $14 million. And Johns's crosshatched abstract from 1979, ""Cicada,"" sold for $6.8 million, under its $7 million low estimate.And then there was Picasso's rainbow-hue portrait from 1937, ""L'Arl√©sienne (Lee Miller),"" that sold for $25 million. It was expected to sell for at least $20 million.Following the Newhouse estate auction, Christie's continued with an evening sale of 20th-century art from other owners, including several landscapes from Mr. Allen's estate. The house expected the billionaire's collection of scenery to sell for $30 million. Several pieces pushed the collective total to $89 million‚Äîincluding Georgia O'Keeffe's 1930 ""White Calico Rose,"" which sold for $13 million and David Hockney's 2000 garden view, ""The Gate,"" which sold for $14.7 million.There is a backlog of estate material in this spring's sales, partially because Mr. Allen's estate took up so much room in last fall's auction catalogs. Caroline Sayan, an art adviser with advisory firm Cadell, said more estates are also expected to hit the marketplace in the coming years as a generation of postwar and baby boomer collectors die and millennials make their mark.Ms. Sayan said a steady pipeline of estates is typically a boon to auctions because such troves have often been hidden away for years‚Äîbut they are landing as the marketplace is also undergoing a generational taste shift among younger buyers who want a broader canon of artists.One notable casualty was a pink Picasso portrait of his mistress Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter that was estimated to sell for at least $20 million yet stalled and went unsold. A few years ago, collectors paid a premium for anything he painted that included the same subject matter. Another Picasso, ""Still Life at the Window,"" which once belonged to dealer Jan Krugier, came up for bid with a $40 million estimate and sold following meager bidding for $41.8 million.""Who is the next bidder and what do they want?"" Ms. Sayan said. ""That's what auction houses are asking now.""One artist who appears to be weathering this generational reckoning: Ed Ruscha, whose 1966-1969's ""Burning Gas Station"" from the estate of Chicago commodities trader Alan Press and his wife, Dorothy sold for $22.3 million at Christie's on Thursday. The Ruscha was estimated to sell for $20 million.And rarity remains a perennial draw: Collectors flocked to Henri Rousseau's 1910 ""Flamingos,"" a whimsical scene that arrived at the sale with a record-level asking price of at least $20 million‚Äînearly five times the artist's auction high bar. A telephone bidder smashed that by ultimately winning it for $44 million.Rousseau is best known for his fantastical jungle scenes, but this piece likely got a boost in part because his works rarely come up for bid at all. Plus, this menagerie hailed from the estate of the late Payne Whitney Middleton, whose late brother John Hay Whitney once served as president of New York's Museum of Modern Art.Additional sales by Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips scheduled for next week will offer a further gauge of the market's trajectory.Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com MORE IN ART & AUCTIONSCredit: By Kelly Crow Word count: 808Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

A $31 million Willem de Kooning. A $35 million Francis Bacon. Anyone worried that the art market might plummet following recent bank failures and broader economic uncertainty can exhale‚Äîfor now.On Thursday, Christie's kicked off New York's spring sale series with a $178 million sale of art from the estate of the late Cond√© Nast chairman Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. Of the 16 pieces in the cache, seven works crossed the $10 million mark. Christie's performance suggests that collectors still feel safe splurging on art trophies vouched for by a tastemaker like Newhouse, who went by Si.Christie's knew it had a hard act to follow after last fall's historic $1.6 billion estate sale of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , so it sought out another name with similar collector heft and a proven track record of drawing bids. Thursday marked the third time Mr. Newhouse's estate has plied pieces into sales since he died six years ago at age 89‚Äîa strategy of trickling artworks onto the marketplace rather than seeking to unload them all at once. The latest batch was expected to sell for between $142 million and $202 million.A 1947 Willem de Kooning, ""Orestes,"" that Mr. Newhouse won for $13.2 million in 2002 resold for $31 million. It was estimated to sell for at least $25 million. Christie's bumped up its estimate for Bacon's 1969 ""Self Portrait"" from $20 million to $22 million ahead of the sale and sold for $35 million. The media mogul paid $8.9 million for the portrait in 2006.A trio of Jasper Johns works in the estate underperformed. The artist's 1971 ""Decoy,"" a graphic overlay of some of his best-known motifs, sold for $10.7 million. It was estimated to sell for at least $14 million. And Johns's crosshatched abstract from 1979, ""Cicada,"" sold for $6.8 million, under its $7 million low estimate.And then there was Picasso's rainbow-hue portrait from 1937, ""L'Arl√©sienne (Lee Miller),"" that sold for $25 million. It was expected to sell for at least $20 million.Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com Credit: By Kelly Crow Word count: 351Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The miracle is that he has found in John Richardson a biographer great enough to stand up to, as well as for, him.The Triumphant Years, the third of four volumes, confirms this life of Picasso as an unrivalled masterpiece among artists' biographies: definitive, insightful, non-judgmental, unprecedented in detail, wearing its learning lightly, and an enormous, gossipy pleasure to read. That is true of all of its volumes, but at the heart of this one is an especially irresistible human story: how Picasso triumphed as the leader of the modern movement through an art which engaged intensely, though very differently, with his love for two women.Richardson opens with Picasso's courtship of his chilly Russian wife, Olga, in 1917 and ends with paintings of predatory physicality from 1931-32 depicting Marie-Therese Walter, the teenager he picked up outside Galeries Lafayette, who inspired ''the most ecstatic and celebratory images of the sexual act by a great artist''.This period of Picasso's work is rich, complex and fascinating. ''La Lampe'' (1931), an iconic painting of a plaster head of Marie- Therese at the studio door in Picasso's country mansion Boisgeloup, implies, says Richardson, ''that although Olga was the chatelaine of Boisgeloup, Marie-Therese, wreathed in tendrils of philodendron, was queen of the sculpture studio''.Olga's reign has intrigued scholars just as it upset the bohemian friends who watched aghast as she decked her husband in stiff suits and held court in pristine apartments bearing no sign of easel or canvas, and attended by white-gloved butlers: ''not the slightest disorder, not a grain of dust.''Picasso had met Olga on the rebound from a wartime affair when he travelled to Rome to work for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Olga, a dancer, was not easily seduced. Diaghilev warned of national prudery - ''une Russe on l'epouse'' - but in Barcelona, Picasso proudly paraded Olga on the Ramblas. Their 1918 wedding was a farce to which the ballerina, crippled by an accident, hobbled on a stick; she never danced again.Richardson reckons that for Picasso, ''bourgeois impersonation was partly an act'', typifying his ''penchant for self-mockery''. ''Comedia!'' he muttered, seeing himself in the mirror at Olga's soirees.In the portraits of Olga, however, there was no mockery. Instead, they embody the return to classicism with which Picasso led the 1920s avant-garde. Their apparent volte-face from cubism left fans ''in a state of resentful confusion'' which Picasso enjoyed: the adoring Jean Cocteau stayed away long enough for Picasso to miss ''having him around to mock, outwit and torture''.Like everything in this classicising epoch, the Olga portraits speak of Picasso's engagement with his place in art history. In 1925 he sold ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' for a paltry FFr25,000; conventional Olga wanted the disorientating masterwork out of the house at any price, but the clincher was that the collector, Jacques Doucet, promised (falsely) to leave the work to the Louvre. The money funded Olga's lavish tastes, but her melancholy, already visible in paintings from 1919 on, deepened. Meanwhile, this phase of Picasso's art had run its course.As Picasso undid the female body all over again, unravelling the contours of his sleepy, docile young lover in ravishing contortions, Richardson argues that his demonic exploitation of Marie-Therese's bright innocence must be seen ''in the darkness of his lifelong grief at the death of his beloved younger sister, Conchita, all those years before in La Corunna'' - when he made a pact with God to abandon painting if the child were spared.The Marie-Therese paintings arch back, through Picasso's classicism and cubism, to childhood terrors and superstitions, and forward - to 1930s deconstructions culminating in ''Guernica'', and beyond.The scale - artistic, psychological, historical - of the author's achievement here is daunting; all other Picasso biographers and memoirists have been overawed into hagiography or frightened into cha-racter assassination. Richardson, a magisterial writer, brilliant critic and deliriously funny raconteur, is a unique, dazzling match for his subject.Jackie Wullschlager is the FT's chief art critic.Word count: 717Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Behind them, two fishermen haul nets. The above etching, an aquatint, is the 97th in a series of 100 etchings commissioned in 1930 from Pablo Picasso by art dealer Ambroise Vollard, and completed over the course of seven years.Grounded in classical mythology and surrealism, the Vollard Suite features two main motifs: the sculptor in his studio and the minotaur - a monstrous creature, half-man, half-bull, that Picasso used to depict his predatory alter-ego.In this print, along with the other four last works in the series, the previously raging minotaur is powerful no more. Anguished and pitiful, it is reliant on the girl for guidance. With her classically beautiful features, she is thought to portray Picasso's muse Marie-Therese Walter, the 17-year-old who supplanted his wife in his affections in the late 1920s.Redolent of tragedy and suffering, the minotaur can also be seen as an allegory of the darkening political situation in Europe in the 1930s, with the approach of the Spanish civil war and the growth of fascism.Displayed with prints by Rembrandt and Goya that inspired Picasso, including Goya's rarely seen Bulls of Bordeaux series, the Vollard Suite is at the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, until December 20.

She was 59.Picasso, who died in 1973, married her in 1961, when he was 79 years old and she was 35. She was a Paris-born divorcee and former dance teacher when she met Picasso, becoming his companion and the model for some fine portraits.Obituary in The Times (London), Oct.17, 1986Even when you're about to be buried they'll dig your reputation a little deeper.""Picasso Intime La Collection de Jacqueline,"" is the finest small show in Paris right now, in the most congenial new space, la Pinacotheque de Paris, just off a nondescript street with the too- promising name of rue de Paradis.As its brochure admits, the Pinacotheque - in what used to be the factory/showroom for Baccarat crystal - is ""derriere les Grands Boulevards."" In other words it's as next to nowhere as you can get in this city.Yet with ""Picasso Intime,"" the Pinacotheque is muscling up against the Centre Pompidou, with its newly minted Joan Mir exhibition, ""1917-1934 La Naissance du monde,"" and the rest of the major galleries closer to the city centre, by asking questions about one of the more fractious art mysteries of the last century.Who was Jacqueline? What was she? Was she merely a canny gold digger who married Pablo Picasso for his spectacular fortune? She did eventually end up with some $48 million (U.S.), long after she ruined his apparently stable relationship with Francoise Gilot, the artist's mistress for many years.Gilot's 1965 response in her bestselling and self-serving autobiography, Life With Picasso, so infuriated the artist that he cut off all ties to Claude and Paloma, his two illegitimate children with Gilot, and erased them out of his will.The above scenario apparently was on the mind of the Times' obituary writer who reminded the reader that Jacqueline was a ""Paris-born divorcee"" and ""former dancer,"" attributes clearly meant to cast shadows on her honour. Jacqueline did little to distance herself from her wicked stepmother reputation when she barred Paloma and Claude from attending their father's funeral.""Picasso Intime"" tells another story, too - in fact several other stories.Primarily it shows Picasso's fascination with Jacqueline, her dark eyes and high cheekbones, her Spanish features. Her looks were in synch with Picasso's creativity as he revisited his early days, his Spanish roots and the works of mentor-figure painters such as Eugene Delacroix and Diego Velazquez.Jacqueline wasn't particularly tall. But in the many portraits that act as silent sentinels as you move through the exhibition, she's shown nobly, seeming larger than life.Picasso viewed old age moodily. In 1963, Georges Braque and Jean Cocteau, colleagues from his earliest days in Paris, both died. And to a great degree it was Jacqueline who helped him keep going - something she was unable to do for herself following his death, when her drinking grew worse and worse, the demons in her head closed in and she threatened suicide.Sombre colours dominate the show, more like Paris in late winter than the Mediterranean under a noonday sun. There are black blues, ghastly whites, ruddy browns, bold black outlines and wintry shadows - as in Portrait de Jacqueline au rocking-chair et au foulard noir (Jacqueline l'echarpe noire) (1954) - which seem to shrowd everything in a dark fog.The town near Mt. Sainte-Victoire in Aix-en-Provence where Picasso and Jacqueline eventually settled, seems un-Mediterranean in Picasso's cool Le Village de Vauvenargues (April 29, 1959), with its dark greens, bland yellows and sharp hills outlined in thick jolts of black.Your only hit of sun and glamour comes ahead of the main exhibition, in a photo display of images taken in the area around Cannes, where Picasso and Jacqueline had earlier set up house before moving to Aix. These shots reveal a sun-drenched Cote d'Azur, where the happy couple play with their animals, including the artist's beloved goat Biquette; clowns around for the camera; and welcomes the rich and the famous, including matador Luis Miguel Dominguin.But it was Jacqueline's attention Pablo sought. Increasingly her role in his life was keeping away all the strangers while he worked, even if they weren't really strangers.Picasso presented many of his portraits, often in her favourite pose - seated, with her arms folded around her bent knees - as presents to her, with little notes attached, such as ""Pour ma femme Jacqueline le 24.2.65"" or ""Pour Jacqueline pour sa fte, son mari.""Also among the presents were early works, such as a young and intense Auto portrait (1917) where he shows himself sitting with his sketchpad on his knee. Clearly this gift was his way of bringing himself closer to her in terms of age.Even his later self-portraits or self-portraits in disguise - Picasso as a matador or as the 17th-century figure in Homme en habit XVII siecle au fond bleu (1967) - were his way of explaining himself to her.""I paint,"" he said, ""the way others write their autobiography.""While the show lacks some of the more substantial later works such as Young Bather With Sand Shovel (1971), it nevertheless bustles with a vitality few older artists can match. Jacqueline could take some measure of credit that ""late Picasso"" wasn't ""forgotten Picasso.""So ""Picasso Intime"" may put a dent in Picasso's life-long reputation as a sexist misogynist who got his Hollywood-style comeuppance in Surviving Picasso, the James Ivory-directed rant where Anthony Hopkins plays the artist as pig and Natascha McElhone plays Gilot, the woman victim who came to hate him.It will be a small dent, though. If Picasso's women got burned by getting close to him, he felt equally burned in return. His first marriage to ballerina Olga Koklova became so self-destructive he imagined its brutal fury with Self-Portrait And Monster (1910). For most of the other women in his life, he was the monster.Not to Jacqueline, though. ""Picasso Intime"" also has work representing his many mistresses, from Fernande Olivier to Marie- Therese Walter to Dora Maar (Gilot is missing).In keeping these portraits, Jacqueline was clearly trying to cast herself above all those who had gone before by proving she could handle her husband's fascination with their bodies and, even more dangerously, their minds.As a character, Jacqueline has already made an appearance in Picasso's Women, Brian McAvera's play about the artist seen from the perspective of the women in his life, in which Jacqueline, once played by Susannah York, is mostly a pathetic figure.But ""Picasso Intime"" gives a different picture. In fact, I think there's a movie in this show, one that may in fact change what's become the accepted storyline of movies about artists as noble, silent sufferers - see Pollock, Vincent And Theo, Lust For Life and all the rest - a notion kept alive most recently in Peter Webber's Girl With A Pearl Earring, in which 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer does the silent suffering.""Picasso Intime"" is about art that comes from interaction of the most personal kind. Of the two words in the title, it's the one about intimacy that's the most provocative. The show closes March 28.pgoddard @ thestar.ca IllustrationAmong the many portraits of Picasso's second wife, Jacqueline en costume turc (1955) is part of the Picasso Intime exhibition currently on at the Pinacotheque de Paris.Credit: Toronto StarWord count: 1297Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

He was referring, of course, to taking inspiration from earlier and contemporary art.While Picasso (1881-1973) is famous for revolutionizing painting, his avant-gardist ceramic creations are not so well known. Picasso and Ceramics, an exhibition at the University of Toronto Art Centre, fills in the gap.This illuminating exhibition, hosted by the university gallery for the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art, includes about 80 earthenware pieces by Picasso dated between 1902 and 1964. These are supplemented by some of Picasso's posters for ceramics exhibitions and sketches of designs.In paintings and pottery, Picasso liked to adapt shapes and motifs from the art of other times and cultures. The exhibition highlights his debt to other potters by providing examples of historical and modern pottery that Picasso might have turned to.The human figure has always been popular with potters. Picasso, who flattened, twisted and distorted the human figure on canvas, treated his clay figures similarly.To make Standing Woman (circa 1948), Picasso pinched a compact and simplified female shape from a freshly thrown flask. Three black dots and one vertical line represent facial features on a small head atop a long neck. Her arms rest at her sides and dissolve into her wide hips and she looks as though she is wearing a black and white striped dress. But the human features are barely there, so the basic bottle shape is still evident.Tanagra in Black and Blue (1947-48) also blurs the border between human and vessel forms. A long-necked woman raises her hands to her small head. This gesture recalls Greek mourning figurines made more than 2,000 years ago in towns such as Tanagra.But while these ancient figurines were intended to be seen as human forms, Picasso's woman looks like an amphora. Her raised arms resemble handles, her long neck is the amphora's neck and her well- rounded hips are the vessel's body.Inspired by ancient potters, Picasso also pulled animal and avian bodies out of vessel shapes. Bird (1947-48) succinctly blends bird and vase. With fused feet and no head, the monochrome black-glazed bird looks like a vase with a tilted body. The body, however, resembles an egg, a subtle reminder of the bird and an echo of Constantin Brancusi's sculptures a quarter-century earlier.In Pitcher with Open Vase (1954), Picasso tries a different kind of modification. He's cut out the side of a sturdy pitcher, thereby rendering the vessel useless in an obvious way. The cutout has the shape of a vase, a kind of vase within a vase, except that the second one is nonexistent.Because Picasso never seems to lose sight of the vessel format, he thinks like a potter. But he never threw his own pots, preferring to decorate and alter pieces already made by potters at the Madoura workshop in Vallauris, in southern France.He also designed unique shapes for them to make.One bonus of this exhibition is a chance to see some vessels made by Suzanne Ramie, a highly innovative potter who owned the Madoura workshop and encouraged Picasso's love affair with ceramics.He especially liked to appropriate her pieces from the drying- board and work on them.Picasso pushed and punched clay to its creative limits but in the end, I think his contributions to painting were more startling and seminal than what he did in ceramics.ShowtimeWHAT: Picasso and CeramicsWHERE: University of Toronto Art Centre, 15 King's College Circle, TorontoWHEN: Until Jan. 23HOURS: 10 to 6 Tuesday to Sunday, 10 to 9 FridayADMISSION: $16, seniors and students $12Regina Haggo, a former professor of art history at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, teaches at the Dundas Valley School of Art.

Nearly 4000 people have seen Love & War since it opened on Friday. NGV deputy director Tony Ellwood said people were coming from all over Victoria and interstate. ""We would expect it to get more than 200,000-plus visitors. The word of mouth seems very positive and the people who are coming out are saying that it's an amazing experience,"" he said.The show focuses on the historic events of 1935 to 1945, a period that took in the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the tumultuous love affair between Pablo Picasso and surrealist photographer Dora Maar, who met in Paris in the winter of 1935-36.Curated by leading Picasso specialist Anne Baldassari, director of the Musee Picasso in Paris, the exhibition features more than 350 works by Picasso and Maar from public and private collections.It is another coup for the NGV, which has previously hosted The Impressionists and works from Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. -- With TELEGRAPHPicasso: Love and War is open until October 8.Word count: 233Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

There are black blues, ghastly whites, ruddy browns, bold black outlines and wintry shadows - as in Portrait de [Jacqueline Picasso] au rocking-chair et au foulard noir (Jacqueline l'echarpe noire) (1954) - which seem to shrowd everything in a dark fog.The town near Mt. Sainte-Victoire in Aix-en-Provence where Picasso and Jacqueline eventually settled, seems un-Mediterranean in Picasso's cool Le Village de Vauvenargues (April 29, 1959), with its dark greens, bland yellows and sharp hills outlined in thick jolts of black.Picasso presented many of his portraits, often in her favourite pose - seated, with her arms folded around her bent knees - as presents to her, with little notes attached, such as ""Pour ma femme Jacqueline le 24.2.65"" or ""Pour Jacqueline pour sa fte, son mari.""

She did eventually end up with some $48 million (U.S.), but not before she ruined his apparently stable relationship with Francoise Gilot, the artist's mistress for many years.Gilot's 1965 response in her bestselling and self-serving autobiography, Life With Picasso, so infuriated the artist that he cut off all ties to Claude and Paloma, his two illegitimate children with Gilot, and erased them out of his will.The above scenario apparently was on the mind of the Times' obituary writer who reminded the reader that Jacqueline was a ""Paris-born divorcee"" and ""former dancer,"" attributes clearly meant to cast shadows on her honour. Jacqueline did little to distance herself from her wicked stepmother reputation when she barred Paloma and Claude from attending their father's funeral.""Picasso Intime"" tells another story, too - in fact several other stories.Primarily it shows Picasso's fascination with Jacqueline, her dark eyes and high cheekbones, her Spanish features. Her looks were in synch with Picasso's creativity as he revisited his early days, his Spanish roots and the works of mentor-figure painters such as Eugene Delacroix and Diego Velazquez.Jacqueline wasn't particularly tall. But in the many portraits that act as silent sentinels as you move through the exhibition, she's shown nobly, seeming larger than life.Picasso viewed old age moodily. In 1963, Georges Braque and Jean Cocteau, colleagues from his earliest days in Paris, both died. And to a great degree it was Jacqueline who helped him keep going - something she was unable to do for herself following his death, when her drinking grew worse and worse, the demons in her head closed in and she threatened suicide.Sombre colours dominate the show, more like Paris in late winter than the Mediterranean under a noonday sun. There are black blues, ghastly whites, ruddy browns, bold black outlines and wintry shadows - as in Portrait de Jacqueline au rocking-chair et au foulard noir (Jacqueline l'echarpe noire) (1954) - which seem to shrowd everything in a dark fog.The town near Mt. Sainte-Victoire in Aix-en-Provence where Picasso and Jacqueline eventually settled, seems un-Mediterranean in Picasso's cool Le Village de Vauvenargues (April 29, 1959), with its dark greens, bland yellows and sharp hills outlined in thick jolts of black.Your only hit of sun and glamor comes ahead of the main exhibition, in a photo display of images taken in the area around Cannes, where Picasso and Jacqueline had earlier set up house before moving to Aix. These shots reveal a sun-drenched Cote d'Azur, where the happy couple plays with its animals, including the artist's beloved goat, Biquette, clowns around for the camera and welcomes the rich and the famous, including matador Luis Miguel Dominguin.But it was Jacqueline's attention Pablo sought. Increasingly her role in his life was keeping away all the strangers while he worked, even if they weren't really strangers.Picasso presented many of his portraits, often in her favourite pose - seated, with her arms folded around her bent knees - as presents to her, with little notes attached, such as ""Pour ma femme Jacqueline le 24.2.65"" or ""Pour Jacqueline pour sa fte, son mari.""Also among the presents were early works, such as a young and intense Auto portrait (1917) where he shows himself sitting with his sketchpad on his knee. Clearly this gift was his way of bringing himself closer to her in terms of age.Even his later self-portraits or self-portraits in disguise - Picasso as a matador or as the 17th-century figure in Homme en habit XVII siecle au fond bleu (1967) - were his way of explaining himself to her.""I paint,"" he said, ""the way others write their autobiography.""While the show lacks some of the more substantial later works such as Young Bather With Sand Shovel (1971), it nevertheless bustles with a vitality few older artists can match. Jacqueline could take some measure of credit that ""late Picasso"" wasn't ""forgotten Picasso.""So ""Picasso Intime"" may put a dent in Picasso's life-long reputation as a sexist misogynist who got his Hollywood-style comeuppance in Surviving Picasso, the James Ivory-directed rant where Anthony Hopkins plays the artist as pig and Natascha McElhone plays Gilot, the woman victim who came to hate him.It will be a small dent, though. If Picasso's women got burned by getting close to him, he felt equally burned in return. His first marriage to ballerina Olga Koklova became so self-destructive he imagined its brutal fury with Self-Portrait And Monster (1910). For most of the other women in his life, he was the monster.Not to Jacqueline, though. ""Picasso Intime"" also has work representing his many mistresses, from Fernande Olivier to Marie- Therese Walter to Dora Maar (Gilot is missing).In keeping these portraits, Jacqueline was clearly trying to cast herself above all those who had gone before by proving she could handle her husband's fascination with their bodies and, even more dangerously, their minds.As a character, Jacqueline has already made an appearance in Picasso's Women, Brian McAvera's play about the artist seen from the perspective of the women in his life, in which Jacqueline, once played by Susannah York, is mostly a pathetic figure.But ""Picasso Intime"" gives a different picture. In fact, I think there's a movie in this show, one that may in fact change what's become the accepted storyline of movies about artists as noble, silent sufferers - see Pollock, Vincent And Theo, Lust For Life and all the rest - a notion kept alive most recently in Peter Webber's Girl With A Pearl Earring, in which 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer does the silent suffering.""Picasso Intime"" is about art that comes from interaction of the most personal kind. Of the two words in the title, it's the one about intimacy that's the most provocative. The show closes March 28.pgoddard @ thestar.ca IllustrationAmong the many portraits of Picasso's second wife, Jacqueline en costume turc (1955) is part of the Picasso Intime exhibition currently on at the Pinacotheque de Paris.Credit: Toronto StarWord count: 1299Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

His mind never rested. The most fecund and innovative artist of his time, he was constantly challenging himself - and us - in his search for new solutions. After some derivative starts and despite an occasional squint at other moderns, he was always original and worked in a great variety of mediums, some of them self- invented.Picasso was also famous because he stirred envy: he had numerous lovers and wives - most of whom are represented here - and lots of money; by drawing a banknote and signing it, he automatically turned it into gold. His Midas touch and his egocentricity were fatal to some of his children. His earthy love life was reflected in many of his drawings, whether formal or overtly erotic; a fixation on women dominates his entire oeuvre.Nothing he did was ever thrown away; just his mark made it valuable, whether it was good or merely indulgent (and occasionally even bad).Happily, there isn't anything bad in Pablo Picasso; Works through a Lifetime, a new Israel Museum show, mainly of works on paper drawn from the nearly 1,000 Picasso prints and drawings in its collection. Most of the prints were donated over the years by Georges Bloch (1901- 1984) of Zurich and this show marks the centenary of his birth; in fact it was made possible by the Bloch Foundation.Bloch, a friend of Picasso, compiled the definitive catalogue raisonne of over 2,200 Picasso prints in various intaglio, lithographic and lino-cut techniques. In 1972, after having previously given 100 prints by various modernists to Jerusalem, Bloch divided his collection into three parts and gave the Israel Museum 350 Picasso prints made between 1910 and 1968, while 350 other prints went to a public collection in Switzerland. The remaining third were sold to establish the Bloch Foundation.There are many portraits in this delightful show, mostly of wives and children, all in different modes, a few referring obliquely to artists Picasso admired and drew upon as a point of departure, like Velazquez.The earliest work is tiny oil from 1902 of a village corrida, nicely brought off but with no indication of the genius soon to emerge. There are few oils in the show, most of them on the theme of bathers and bathing from the recently acquired Lejwa bequest; Lady by the Shore, a standing nude, is as much drawn as painted, with a wonderfully controlled brush contour defining an invented but believable anatomy. A great work, it is a bit overwhelmed by its undeniably handsome frame. Illustration7 photos; Caption: Pablo Picasso: Francoise, lithograph, 1950. Pablo Picasso: Face (Marie-Therese Walther?)

We are familiar with Pablo Picasso, voracious devourer and discarder of women. Now please welcome Pablo Picasso, quipmeister par excellence.This new view of one of the 20th century's most exhaustively chronicled figures comes courtesy of Jeffrey Hatcher's play A Picasso, a formulaic two-hander that opened Tuesday night at New York City Centre's Stage II in a polished production from the Manhattan Theatre Club.It is the autumn of 1941, more than a year after Paris fell to the Germans. The heavy tread of Nazi jackboots can be heard on the streets outside the underground bunker, where the celebrated painter, played by Dennis Boutsikaris, sits cooling his heels. (Allen Moyer's expert set evokes an atmosphere of clammy claustrophobia.)Enter Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), a coiled, crisp blonde wearing ominous shoulder pads: Joan Crawford styled by Albert Speer. Miss Fischer works for the German cultural ministry and has been charged with the task of authenticating three ""confiscated"" artworks. She has had the artist detained to help her out. (Hatcher's fictional plot is loosely inspired by actual events.) Picasso is suspicious: What do the Nazis want with his drawings? As he says, ""Germans want kittens and dogs and Poland."" (Zing!)The first of Hatcher's carefully sprung surprises arrives after Picasso has proudly identified all three paintings as his own. Miss Fischer lets slip that an invitation to a group exhibition in the works won't be forthcoming. The Nazis may be evil to the core, but they aren't so tacky as to invite an artist to witness the burning of his own work.Aghast, Picasso strikes a deal with the secretly simpatico Miss Fischer to disavow the testimonials he has just given, at least in two of the three cases: All his interrogator needs is ""a Picasso,"" a single work to feed the bonfire of ""degenerate"" art being planned.And so, in the guise of offering Miss Fischer a scholarly assessment certifying two of the paintings as forgeries, Picasso embarks, somewhat illogically, on a series of reminiscences of his life and loves.Hatcher has absorbed the myriad viewpoints put forth in the standard biographies, and, with the help of Miss Fischer's tart rejoinders, reveals both the dark and the light, the tender soul and the ruthless ego of the hard-working womanizer and prolific genius. If it does not contain any real insights into the psychology of a much-scrutinized man, the play does serve as a modest primer for the Picasso-oblivious.Few attempts are made to solve the mystery of his contradictions. Hatcher simply presents them with a shrug. And so Picasso scornfully talks of the artist's supreme indifference to politics - ""I do not choose ideologies or countries!"" - but in the next breath is loudly proclaiming, ""I am prouder of Guernica than of anything else I have ever done.""Boutsikaris, whose dark eyes have some of the piercing quality of Picasso's, delivers the manifestos with the proper ringing tone, the scornful appraisals of ex-wives and ex-lovers with an arrogant smirk. And when Picasso exercises his unexpected fondness for acerbic aphorisms (""If you've spent any time in France, you'll know soap is far more precious than gold""), he displays confident comic timing, leaving the vague impression that Picasso spent a summer or two in the Spanish equivalent of the Catskills.Miss Fischer, trying to remain firmly in control of this testy colloquy, is not to be outquipped, although her witticisms are sometimes tasteless. ""Do you still have queers in Germany?"" Picasso asks. ""Not so much lately,"" she replies. Eikenberry, a sensitive actress, deploys a look of secret suffering to clue us in to Miss Fischer's softer side. The character oscillates between sympathy and antagonism toward her detainee, speaking tenderly of her reverence for Picasso's art in one sequence, baring sharp Nazi fangs in the next.John Tillinger's snappy direction smooths away some of the contrivances of Hatcher's neatly diagrammed plot. But it cannot mask the frequent lapses into mechanical rhythms and predictable cliches. In a discussion of the death of Picasso's great friend Guillaume Apollinaire, Miss Fischer pointedly asks, ""What does one call a man who, on hearing of his dearest friend's death, draws his own portrait before anything else?""The booming reply: ""An artist.""A Picasso, by Jeffrey Hatcher, directed by John Tillinger, is at New York City Centre Stage II, 131 W. 55th St., Manhattan, until May 29.

[[missing key: loadingAnimation]]The full text may take 40-120 seconds to translate; larger documents may take longer.CancelOverlayEndIn his lecture, [Leo Steinberg] fleshed out and nailed down the vague old notion that [Pablo Picasso]'s cubism did away with traditional Renaissance perspective and replaced it with a free-floating modern eye. As Steinberg spelled that old position out, cubism rejected a single view into coherent space caught from a single point of view at one moment in time -- think of any of Vermeer's domestic scenes. Instead, Picasso's cubist pictures pulled apart our vision of reality, even maybe how we think about the world, into all of its component parts. Picasso was ""impatient with the conventional image that rations him to one view at a time,"" Steinberg said.In one impressive dissection, Steinberg showed how the head in one of Picasso's very first, pre-cubist drawings of [Fernande Olivier], which at first seems strangely bloated, is in fact a cobbling together of two different viewpoints. It lets Picasso show his mistress's face in a three-quarters view, while her ear and the back of her head are shown in profile.

He was giving a lecture called ""The Intelligence of Picasso,"" which was inspired by ""Picasso: The Cubist Portraits of Fernande Olivier,"" the gallery's close-up of the Spanish painter's first steps toward cubism that is on display through Jan. 19.At 83, Steinberg delivered a lecture that lived up to his reputation as one of the great thinkers, writers and talkers about art. His talk may be over and done with, but its ideas about Picasso and the birth of cubism -- one of the crucial watersheds in art -- demand long mulling over.Steinberg's argument wasn't revolutionary (unlike some of his past work, on themes such as the sexuality of Christ in art, which put the discipline all in a tizzy). It was illustrated, however, with some of the most perceptive close readings of works of art that you could ever find. Some of Steinberg's larger conclusions might be debated -- but put his acute observations into contact with some current ideas in perceptual psychology, and you can start to understand more of what's going on in cubism.In his lecture, Steinberg fleshed out and nailed down the vague old notion that Picasso's cubism did away with traditional Renaissance perspective and replaced it with a free-floating modern eye. As Steinberg spelled that old position out, cubism rejected a single view into coherent space caught from a single point of view at one moment in time -- think of any of Vermeer's domestic scenes. Instead, Picasso's cubist pictures pulled apart our vision of reality, even maybe how we think about the world, into all of its component parts. Picasso was ""impatient with the conventional image that rations him to one view at a time,"" Steinberg said.In one impressive dissection, Steinberg showed how the head in one of Picasso's very first, pre-cubist drawings of Fernande, which at first seems strangely bloated, is in fact a cobbling together of two different viewpoints. It lets Picasso show his mistress's face in a three-quarters view, while her ear and the back of her head are shown in profile. Split the portrait down the middle, and view each half on its own -- Steinberg did it for us in his slides -- and you see two perfectly coherent glimpses of a head. It's only when they get assembled into a single picture that everything seems somehow off. As the Picasso exhibition shows, Fernande's head went on to become the ""preferred testing ground"" for the artist's most radical experiments -- for his ""shattering of every smug continuity,"" as Steinberg put it.Steinberg also showed another slightly later Picasso, of a woman in a chair, in which the artist seems to have arbitrarily dropped one shoulder lower than the other -- just to be stylishly odd and angstful, you might think at first. But in yet another demonstration of virtuoso pictorial analysis, Steinberg convincingly showed that by again separating the two halves of the picture, you could identify the raised shoulder as capturing the woman seen from up above, and the lowered one as signaling a view from straight ahead or from somewhat below. Though Steinberg didn't go this far, the implication is that the portrait also conveys two different relationships between artist and sitter: one as the standing artist, in control of the situation, approaches the woman, and the other once he's lowered himself to her level -- as observer, as equal, maybe even as supplicant.Then Steinberg went on to take apart some complex still lifes. He demonstrated how Picasso could show us a standard still life of a table, but with the tabletop seen at once from above and below. In another still life, of a single glass, all the vessel's attributes - - its transparency and its roundness and its shapely profile, as well as the access it gives to the wooden surface of the table seen through it -- could be pulled apart and rendered in different spots on the picture plane. In a third still life, a short stretch of parallel lines stands for the substantial thickness of its table top, but they have nothing to do with another line, a single diagonal this time, that stands for the recession into space of the table's drawer -- a drawer that might just as well come from an entirely different picture, for all it has to do with how all the table's other bits are drawn.This kind of subtle, maybe even intuitive, purely visual conception of a radically new pictorial world is what Steinberg meant by ""the intelligence of Picasso"" and he shows it operating at genius level. Picasso solves one problem, then moves on to the next, remaining in a state of constant, fertile ""exploratory despair,"" in Steinberg's words, that few other artists have managed to stay in for so long.But I think that Picasso's constant exploration, and maybe his despair, doesn't come from solving problems and then being forced to move on to new challenges. It comes from discovering that, in the case of cubism at least, his problem is inherently unsolvable.Steinberg refers to Renaissance realism as nothing more than a ""common usage"" that Picasso wants to break free of. The artist hoped to end up with a more complete rendition of the world with fewer arbitrary limits. Attacked for his ""monstrous"" distortions, Picasso replied that his goal was resemblance, ""but a resemblance more profound, more real than the real."" Picasso works to achieve this goal, according to Steinberg, by making visual thought ""approximate the habits of language,"" with all the flexibility that entails. It's the flexibility to mention a glass, say, without getting any more specific about the precise kind of glass that you have in mind, or to pull apart all the separate features of an object and discuss them one by one -- as Picasso does, in paint, in the still lifes analyzed by Steinberg.Picasso struggled to turn traditional still life into a ""sign situation,"" where individual bits of information get their meaning by playing off each other, rather than through a fixed relationship to some outside reality. For Picasso, said Steinberg, ""the visual representation of things need not mirror them, but could refer to things the way that language does."" He imagines these pictures working more like a clever made-up code than like a footprint in the sand that unquestionably shows that someone has passed by.The problem with all this, however, is that in practice -- including Picasso's practice -- it turns out that pictures can't work much like language does. It's true that Picasso does away with a unified perspective that's coherent right across the surface of a single picture. But he can't shake free of perspective-based realism in each of that picture's smallest component parts; he has to follow rules for showing them that have less leeway than anything you'd find in language.Picasso's double-angled view of the seated woman is only recognizable as such because each half has a single point of view: One half is a view from straight ahead, the other one from up above. You could even argue that pictures like this don't undermine perspective at all; they demonstrate its inescapable force in all representation. The portrait's double view could be said to have twice as much perspective as pictures that had come before it, rather than half as much or none at all.In the still lifes that Steinberg does such a brilliant job dissecting, all the separable bits that add up to an object are in fact straightforward, traditional renditions of visual details: A glass's shape is rendered by a drawn profile or a scissored edge; a drawer's recession is shown by a diagonal racing toward a vanishing point; a table's thickness gets an outline drawing of two edges with a gap between -- all standard elements in classic representation. By assembling different aspects of an object into a single picture, Picasso's not doing anything to revolutionize the very nature of depiction: It's what most non-Western cultures do, as well as our own kids before we teach them otherwise.Crowds of contemporary philosophers and psychologists -- unfortunately, only rarely in contact with art historians -- have done work to underline how very different representation is from other kinds of languages and codes and symbol systems. Representation has a special set of ties to features in the world that language simply doesn't have: ""Dog"" and ""hund"" and ""chien"" can all point to the same thing, but there aren't three ways of painting a dog that don't have a lot in common with each other, and with the real-life dog they point a viewer to. If a picture's going to recall an object, it has to capture certain things about the way the world is made. All recognizable pictures seem to be made up of a very few recurring elements that allow flat surfaces to depict the world: They use a handful of cues to tell us about surfaces and edges, about shapes and colors and textures and the other qualities of things. There's not much more that any figurative artist can do than emphasize some of those elements instead of others, or reorganize the way they fit together, as Picasso does.What's more, recent research has shown that a single viewpoint, like the one used by artists from Leonardo to Ingres, is inherent in many of these building blocks of picture-making: Even when people blind from birth are asked to draw, they use lines the way that artists do, and often with a single viewpoint in mind. It may not even be possible to think about an object in space -- which blind people do as well as anyone -- without imagining how its position must relate to yours. So cubism's goal of capturing a roving eye and the special 3-D substantiveness of things -- the idea that things are there to be walked around and touched, as well as calmly contemplated -- may simply be impossible on a flat, unchanging surface like a painter's canvas. Cubism can assemble bunches of static, perspectival glimpses of the world onto a single canvas, but it can't make those glimpses any less static or less bound to a single viewpoint than they've always been.I think that's what Picasso in the end discovered in his exploration. When he tried to show two views of a single woman's head, he didn't really capture an extra sense of roundness. He just got a single head that people tend to read as strangely swollen, unless a thinker as clever as Steinberg spends time unpacking something else the picture might imply.When Picasso tried to find a new way to render the three- dimensionality of Fernande's forehead by turning it into a row of cube-like forms, as in several portraits in the National Gallery show, all he got was a picture of someone who seems to have ""pleated brows,"" in Steinberg's own words. Picasso cannot change the fundamental way a picture renders objects -- that's pretty much a given, because of how the world and pictures work. We're wired to read the world -- including pictures of it -- in pretty much one way, and there's almost nothing any artist or historian can do to change that fact.As Picasso went further and further into his radical cubist project, it drew further and further away from the real world, and closer and closer to complete abstraction. The last portraits in the Picasso exhibition break representation down so thoroughly that they barely render what their titles say they're pictures of. No danger of misreading them as having swollen heads or pleated brows because you can hardly find a head or brow to say such things about. I love the way these almost-abstract pictures look, but I can't pretend that that's because of how they make me see their sitters. In the quasi-abstraction of cubism, Picasso has forged a brand-new, hugely influential and fantastic kind of picture-making. But he hasn't found a brand-new way to make pictures depict the world.Steinberg quoted one of Picasso's last bons mots: ""Reality haunts these pictures,"" he said, ""like a perfume."" Which means that you can only find the barest whiff of it, for all cubism's claims to forge a whole new form of realism.Word count: 2101Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

And soon even Matisse would be incorporated within the wider Picassoean vocabulary -- just one of myriad elements Picasso was able to draw on.It is the ironic paradox of the absolutely singular genius -- there is in the end no one to be influenced by except oneself.After a while -- for some critics after Guernica in 1937, for others even after 1919 with his turn to Neo-Classicism -- the ""late"" Picasso machine grinds out its endless variations, no longer finding inspiration either in some ""original"" contact with its artistic materials or in resolving, say, the profound intellectual problems of Cubism.SUCCESSIVELY Ingres, Delacroix, Velasquez and Manet are swallowed up and spat back out in a style that invariably looks like Picasso. There is no longer any real engagement with these works -- with their form or the artistic thinking they represent -- but only with their easily recognisable content. Picasso's late work becomes a series of virtuosic variations on what has effectively been turned into kitsch -- the painterly equivalent of John Coltrane's brilliant but ultimately unlistenable 14-minute version of My Favourite Things.As much as anything, it is this tremendously seductive orthodoxy that has developed around Picasso's work that curator Terence Maloon's Picasso: The Last Decades, currently on at the Art Gallery of NSW until February 16, seeks to overturn.Does Picasso's late period witness a kind of creative impasse, even one brought about by his very genius?Does his final work evidence a decline in his creative powers, perhaps for the obvious reason that he was growing old, that his hand was wavering, that his eyesight was dimming?These questions or doubts Picasso: The Last Decades answers with a resounding no.Take gallery boss Edmund Capon, who writes in his foreword of the ""sheer forthrightness of Picasso who, especially in his later years and in characteristic defiance of the inevitability of old age, confronted his life and imaginings with undaunted energy and absolutely no concessions"".Of course, this is sheer hype, the kind of thing they let gallery directors get away with at the front of catalogues -- but listen to Maloon himself. As he asks in a series of rhetorical questions: ""Distortion was old hat? Picasso distorted with such humour, expressive skills and dramatic force that it could take your breath away.""His art a closed book? Picasso could open the chapters at random, and take his pick of innumerable works from the past. Bypassed by history? Picasso could give the younger generation a history lesson which would validate his art's continuing role in it.""And so on. The trouble with Picasso: The Last Decades is that, in its desire to rehabilitate the late production of Picasso -- a desire undoubtedly driven as much by the box office as by scholarly rigour -- it risks turning into mere boosterism, or the old tactic of saying that what was bad is now good, what was marginal is now central.Nowhere in the catalogue are the basic questions asked that would allow us properly to consider this question of the ""late"" Picasso.For instance, what is it that constitutes this ""late"" period?Continued BAM 2Pablo Picasso's end gameFrom BAM 1The show, predictably, goes for the biographical explanation -- the late period begins in 1953 when Picasso meets Jacqueline Roque, the last of the six important wives or mistresses who were to run through his life.It is an interpretation that -- not coincidentally -- allows the Gallery to include its own Nude in a Rocking Chair (1956) as one of the foundational works in the exhibit, as though it really inaugurated something new.But, as I say, there are art historical readings that see Picasso's late period -- in the sense of a decline in the quality of his paintings -- beginning in 1937 after Guernica, or -- in the sense of the recycling of other artistic styles -- as early as 1919 with his abandoning of Cubism and his adoption of Ingres' Classicism.Beginning as it does with Picasso's work of the early '50s, the show probably does not do enough with the fact that this corresponds to the period of Matisse's death -- the way that the two most important works in the show, Nude in a Rocking Chair and Studio 30 (1955) are a final coming to terms with Matisse's influence, at once a breaking of his spell and his incorporation within Picasso's system.So, if there is a distinctive late style in Picasso, if the last decades herald an unexpected artistic breakthrough, in what does it consist?There admittedly are some extraordinary works in the show, some of the absolute cornerstones of Picasso's achievement -- the series of Studios-- at La Californie on the French Riviera of 1955-7; the variations on Delacroix's Femmes d'Alger of 1954-5, on Velasquez' Las Meninas of 1957, on Manet's Dejeuner sur l'herbe of 1960-1. There are the series of crazed-looking portraits, the so-called ""travesties"", of the late '60s and early '70s; and the famous Self- Portrait of 1972 with its staring dead eyes, allegedly Picasso's final work.But the kind of painterly Cubist style most of these works represent -- a fusion of the skeletal armature of Analytic Cubism and the colour and decoration of Synthetic Cubism -- was something Picasso had been working on since the mid-'30s, after he had abandoned Surrealism.No, if Picasso's late work does represent a new ""formal"" principle -- and this is a hypothesis that the catalogue, for all its air of challenging orthodoxy, never gets close to suggesting -- it is the deliberately ""bad"" painting that overtook Europe a few years after his death in the form of Neo-Expressionism.Picasso was an artist who famously did not edit his work, who advised younger painters to ""paint the first thing that came into their head"", who decided to let everything out of the studio and allow the public to judge.And it is something like this deliberate flouting of taste and even of artistic competency that is finally compelling about the late Picasso -- it is perhaps this in the end that pushes him past Matisse and makes him a touchstone for our age.The work of Pollock is ""ugly"" in the same way, and the art historian T.J. Clark recently wrote a book, Farewell to an Idea, that attempted to make a case for the ""ugly"" and ""minor"" as the essence of Modernism.This is the true iconoclasm of Picasso -- his deliberate breaking of all the rules of artistic decorum, his willingness to be ""minor"" - - and it is a far more radical proposition than simply claiming that he continues painting with undiminished power, raging against the dying of the light.Picasso: The Last Decades is not to be missed, but not for any reasons the catalogue gives. If great art is truly ""anachronistic"", as it claims, it is not to be captured by any straightforward explanation or apology, for it will always turn these against themselves.We have got to think harder about great art than either the humanistic cliche of the genius trapped by their own talent or the simple inversion of this.Our interpretations must be as daring as the art, take as great a risk -- we must in a way say the first thing that comes into our heads: that this art is ugly, that it does fail. And then ask: what does this mean? Why is it like this? Only then might we meet that imposing stare.ART EXHIBITIONS, ART AND ARTISTS IllustrationCaption: Appears on M02 VISION . . . from the left, Woman in a Rocking Chair, The Last Decades (5), Woman with Turkish Headdress and Woman and Children.

As it was, the pig's brains and other curious substances in the Essendon supplements saga gifted Carlton a finals wildcard and ensured a showdown with another old foe, Richmond. When Pablo Picasso painted The Old Guitarist he was in the midst of a bleak personal time, known as his Blue Period. Carlton fans questioning their team's finals legitimacy need only look at the Spanish masters' life. Following his Blue Period was his 'Rose' period after which he never looked back. With some justification, Blues talisman and former skipper Chris Judd possibly felt he had experienced everything possible in footy - premierships, Brownlow medals, suspension and accolades. But never, ever the role of a fading star in a mediocre team which still might just have enough music left for one last jig at the big dance.WIN A JIM For details on how to win an original print on fine art paper go to SPORT 20 To download your own print and to see others from the 'Big week in art' series go online to: realfooty.com.au or http://bit.ly/171EuuBWord count: 251Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But I have always thought it wrong to say we are visually illiterate. In fact, the English in their way are discriminating about the look of things, not least horses, gardens and foreign cars. Right now it is said that ""icon"" is the most over- used word in the language. Equally, everywhere you go people talk of ""brand values"". This use of language betrays our perpetual fascination with imagery.Brands are especially interesting. The word probably comes from the identifying marks cowboys burnt onto steers, but has now mutated into a powerful notion that unites art with business and money. Not that they were ever really separate. In a world where the technical mysteries of production have been solved, the intangibles of a brand are the most valuable assets. Once, people fussed about the importance of product design. Then they fussed about corporate identity. Now all the fussing is being done by brand managers.If you visit the headquarters of Audi at Ingolstadt and meet the chief designer, he gives you a business card that says ""Audi Brand Group"". The cars may be Volkswagens in drag, but their brand values distinguish them and justify higher prices. Brand values are all about association and expectation and you build them through having a strong identity, a heavy weight of advertising, consistency in PR ... and, of course, a worthwhile product.And the name is important too. Akio Morita realised this when in 1955 he had the happy insight that ""Sony"" was snappier than Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushika Kaika. Picasso had done the same. Born Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Angeles Remedios Cipriano de la Santisima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso, he rapidly developed a brand strategy of his own. His first paintings are signed with the patronymic ""P Ruiz"". He later adds his mother's maiden name to become ""P Ruiz Picasso"". Then ""P R Picasso"". By 1902, the ""Picasso"" brand was launched.Initially, it was Picasso's fine product that created his reputation. Later his wealth became a source of fascination in itself. Financially independent by the age of 28, at the time of his death he had perhaps 500 of his own canvases. Today these might be worth several billion in whatever hard currency you care to mention. But Picasso always controlled the relationship between production and distribution. As John Berger said in The Success and Failure of Picasso (1965), he knew that ""the works would have to be sold tactfully, so as not to flood the market"". Or, in other words, he had a premium product strategy that would be the envy of Unilever. Quite intuitively, it seems, Picasso understood the voodoo of brand management. ""Actually, I wanted to become a painter,"" he once admitted. ""Now I have become Picasso."" This is wittily explained in a brilliant book by Bernd Kreutz, one of Germany's leading ad men (The Art of Branding, Hatje Cantz Verlag, Ostfildern-Ruit, 2003).Every step of his career was handled with calculation and enterprise. Success would never have been achieved in his native Malaga, nor La Coruna, nor even in Barcelona. Instead, Picasso saw that the emerging Paris art market with its new generation of private collectors was ripe to exploit. First he did what the brand managers call ""benchmarking"", assessing the market leaders. Thus, early Picassos had their similarities to Pissarro, Toulouse- Lautrec, Cezanne and Degas - market leaders in their day. But Picasso had a product development programme of his own. Fifty years before Detroit created the annual model change (which Vance Packard condemned as ""planned obsolescence""), Picasso excited demand with new styles. Collectors dutifully moved from his Blue Period to his Rose Period and then to Cubism. Just as Apple launches new products when there is still demand for the old, Picasso's fidgety creativity kept the market alive. The critic Georges Besson said he was as ""mercurial as a crowd"".And long before anyone recognised the importance of word-of- mouth in getting obscure or advanced products to the tipping point of acceptability, Picasso had established networking. His brand values were continuously reinforced by his critics and his dealers. And Ambroise Vollard, Paul Durand-Ruel, Apollinaire and Gertrude Stein were fed a continuous diet of freebies. He formed a strategic alliance - just short of a merger - with Georges Braque, but did a buy-out when he needed more market share and Braque's sluggish performance was inhibiting growth. Even when collaborating on the Cubist product launch, Picasso's dealer Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler enforced the premium strategy by charging four times more for his pictures than for Braque's.And Picasso was no blurry mystic. Instead, he controlled his brand image with a high degree of self-consciousness. Brand extension was limited to graphics and ceramics (with a few theatrical joint ventures) and he only ever allowed his picture to be taken by the leading photographers of the day: Robert Doisneau, Man Ray and Irving Penn among them. Seven long-suffering women enhanced his reputation for prodigality, confirming the truth of the old saying that a bad reputation never did anyone any harm. PR was important too: Guernica became the most famous painting of the 20th century because of the painter's adroit manipulation of the media. So effective was this communications policy that 20 years after he died an inter-national survey showed that spontaneous recognition of the brand was 84 per cent (higher than that of the US President of the day).Picasso is a metaphor for the condition of art. In exactly the same way brand managers turn imagery into money, Picasso could do the same. It was said that shopkeepers in Antibes never bothered cashing his cheques because, no matter what their face value, the signature alone was worth more. Whatever he wanted - a house, a woman - Picasso simply had to draw. He certainly had the Midas touch ... but, then, Midas starved because you cannot eat gold.Despairing of his former partner's ruthless and inventive creativity, and perhaps a little jealous of his high profile, Georges Braque once said: ""Picasso used to be a great painter. Now he is just a genius."" Today, for ""genius"" read ""brand"".Word count: 1061Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

""Or if it is, it is not art."" Despite the artist's bent for frankness, many of his earthier sketches, notebooks and paintings have long been hidden in drawers or behind curtains -- until now.Picasso Erotique (Erotic Picasso), in the Jeu de Paume gallery in the Tuileries gardens, runs through May 20. The show reaches into the artist's prolific sexual imagination and traces a line from his adolescent initiations with prostitutes through his famous romances to his final meditations on love and aging.The exhibit then moves to Montreal's Musee des Beaux-Arts from June 14 to Sept. 16, then Barcelona, Spain.More than half the 300 or so works in the collection have been kept from public viewing until now -- including a 1903 oil painting owned by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, which has never dared display the scene depicting a very young Picasso in a bordello.Jean-Jacques Lebel, an artist and writer who knew Picasso and was instrumental in mounting the exhibit, said half the works on display are being shown for the first time to museum-goers.""This is supposed to be the most famous artist of his century,"" Lebel said.""Everybody's so jaded, and they think they've seen everything, but we're proving that's not the case.""Many of Picasso's sketches and paintings were hidden out of fear of tainting his marketability -- especially in North America, home to most of the artist's fans, Lebel said. Collectors on the other side of the Atlantic were unwilling to accept scenes depicting explicit sexual acts, which Picasso drew repeatedly.Other intimate works, especially sketches and notebooks, were carefully guarded by his muses, such as Dora Maar, who became devoutly religious after her breakup with Picasso in the 1940s.One work in the collection, a fanciful sexual comic strip, resurfaced after Maar died in 1997. By then, she had torn out a few of the most revealing pages.Credit: Associated PressWord count: 373Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

""An exceptional collection which has rarely been seen and will be very difficult to bring together again in the future.""The show also celebrates the 125th anniversary of the Malaga- born artist's birthday. Picasso died in Paris in 1973.""It's not enough to describe it as a great exhibition,"" one of the show's curators, Francisco Calvo Serraller, told a pre-launch presentation last week. ""It's inconceivable, unheard of, a historic event which transcends art and demonstrates how the tragedies of war were reflected in Spain.""The Prado, normally dedicated to pre-19th century works, has given over its elegant central gallery to contrasting Picasso's works with those of painters he confessed were his inspirational mentors.The star attractions of the Prado leg will be comparisons between Velazquez's Las Meninas, painted in 1656, and Picasso's black, grey and white versions of the work from the 1950s. Several metres away are Picasso's versions of Goya's The Naked Maja of 1797.Ten minutes down Madrid's tree-lined Paseo del Prado is the Reina Sofia museum for modern art -- where the second part of the exhibit focuses on the giant anti-war canvas Guernica. Picasso painted it to denounce the 1937 indiscriminate air bombing by Franco's German allies of the small Basque town of the same name.Nearby are Goya's The Shootings of May 3rd and Manet's Execution of Emperor Maximilian.The show, which runs until Sept. 3, was inaugurated this week by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia.Credit: Associated PressWord count: 367Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The nonprofit Greentree Foundation, established by John Hay and Betsey Cushing Whitney, is selling the work.Collectors such as the foundation are eager to convert some of their holdings into cash after three years of record-breaking auctions, Moffett said. New York's fall fine-art sales in November brought in $482.3 million, surpassing previous-year sales by 20 per cent and setting more than three dozen artist records.""You're finally getting some of this discretionary selling that we've been hoping for a long time,"" said auction analyst George Sutton, 36, of Minneapolis-based Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC. ""The old adage that death, divorce and debt are the three things that precipitate sales doesn't seem to be quite as true now.""The lure of a seller's market may also be attracting inferior work, Bob Monk, 53, director of the Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue, said after examining catalogues for the postwar and contemporary sales.""It's not bringing out the best stuff,"" Monk said. ""There are people out there looking for work, so maybe this B and C work will find homes.""The Picasso, from the artist's Rose period, is being offered as part of a May 5 sale of 34 paintings from a collection amassed by John Hay Whitney, the philanthropist, diplomat and publisher of the New York Herald Tribune, who died in 1982 at age 77. His wife, Betsey Cushing, left the works to the foundation when she died at age 89 in 1998.""There was no pressure"" to sell, said Richard Schaffer, 57, president of the Greentree Foundation. ""It seemed like a reasonable time given what we hope will be a receptive art market."" The proceeds will be used to renovate the 160-hectare Whitney estate in Manhasset, N.Y., which hosts international meetings to promote peace, Schaeffer said.Sellers in May also include New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Anderson Fine Arts Center in Anderson, Ind., and German fashion designer Wolfgang Joop, 59. Another is the Fran and Ray Stark Foundation, established by Ray Stark, the producer of such films as The Night of the Iguana and Annie, who died in January at 88.""Some people want to capitalize and sell their assets as close to the top of the market as possible,"" Moffett said. ""Other people want to refine their collections so they trade out of some artists and into others.""New York's spring auction season begins Tuesday with a sale of Impressionist and Modern art at Christie's International PLC and continues Wednesday and Thursday with Sotheby's Whitney sale and Impressionist and Modern works from various owners. The following week, both auctioneers offer postwar and contemporary art, as does Phillips, de Pury & Co.Tobias Meyer, 41, worldwide head of contemporary art at Sotheby's, said almost everything he is selling May 12 came from discretionary sellers. In Sotheby's private viewing room, he pointed out a number of works offered this season because their owners expect prices to soar.A Jasper Johns watercolour on paper, Corpse and Mirror, is estimated by Sotheby's at $2 million to $3 million. Meyer said the seller, whom he wouldn't name, told him he wants to sell after owning the painting for 12 years because: ""Now is the moment.""Monk of the Gagosian Gallery said the Johns work is ""a seminal piece from an era when Johns started to focus on abstract work"" -- meaning ""the estimate is warranted.""The Christie's contemporary art sale features a number of works estimated above $1 million, including premiere examples by Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter and Jackson Pollock.The Pollock, Number 12, 1949, estimated at $5 million to $7 million, is one of nine artworks being sold by New York's Museum of Modern Art to reinvest in ""works of greater importance,"" according to a statement by chief curator John Elderfield, 61.MoMA's Il Grande Metafisico, a 1917 oil by Giorgio De Chirico, estimated at $7 million to $10 million, is a highlight of Christie's Impressionist and Modern sale on Tuesday. The auctioneer also has a 1919 Amedeo Modigliani, Portrait de Roger Dutilleul, for $6 million to $8 million and an abstract Joan Miro of 1947, Le Rouge, Le Bleu, Le Bel Espoir, for $4 million to $6 million.Prices expected at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern sale are higher, with several estimated at more than $10 million. Besides the $70-million Picasso, Sotheby's is auctioning an Edouard Manet horseracing scene, Les Courses Au Bois De Boulogne, for $20 million to $30 million.It also is offering a 40-inch-by-79-inch (102-cm-by-201-cm) Claude Monet water lily painting, Le Bassin Aux Nympheas, from the Stark Foundation for $9 million to $12 million and Picasso's 1932 depiction of a day at the beach, Le Sauvetage, from a private European collection, for $10 million to $15 million.

Taking a pace forward, to satisfy himself that the gentleman's other hand was not going to waste, Mr Hackett was shocked to find it limply dangling over the back of the seat, with between its fingers the spent three-quarters of a cigarette.'Why is this scene like a picture?It's partly because Mr Hackett is like a picture-viewer, intimately observing an intimate scene, without (it seems) any sense of intrusion or fear of detection. But it's also in how the two lovers are described. They are not presented as entire bodies. They are a series of isolated body parts: ears, hand, tongue, mouth, thigh, another hand. They appear in disconnected fragments and glimpses, which is how bodies often appear in pictures.In pictures, things are always being obscured and interrupted by other things. Bodies disappear behind bodies and then reappear the other side. They exist, not whole, but as a series of emerging parts. It's for the viewer to make the relevant connections, to fill in the missing, unseen pieces.And some pictures deliberately make this difficult. They make it hard to see how the parts of a body are supposed to connect up. Gustav Klimt, for example, scatters his bodies. He paints swathes of ornamental material, and then "" here and there "" there's a gap, and a bit of flesh appears. He does it in his famous Kiss, where you get the heads, hands, and feet of the lovers, but how these extremities join up into bodies behind their ornate robes is anyone's guess. It's a rather clammy effect. It can also be done with gusto, though. Take Picasso's Women Running on the Beach .Picasso was strongly drawn to the seaside. It is his arcadia. Woods and fields and riverbanks hold nothing for him. It is on the beach, on the shores of the Med, among bathers and sunbathers and beach huts, that he finds his ideal world of love and pleasure and play. It is not always a happy world. There can be pain, cruelty and betrayal in it. But here it's at its most exuberant. The picture is like a beach postcard. Its red-white-blue scheme carries a subliminal feeling of a tricoleur flag flapping in the wind.Things are not absolutely jolly. The two women are running together, hand in hand "" but obviously racing too. Picasso doesn't have lesbian fantasies, women alone enjoying each other. He can't put two girls together without suggesting a catfight. The runners are competing, and one of them is dramatically out-running her rival. The dynamic of the picture is in the way each figure is in front of and behind the other one.Picasso sometimes does elaborate and elusive variations on human bodies where you can hardly follow what's going on. Here the distortions are demonstratively clear. You have the two figures, heavy limbed and pelting forward, with a terrific momentum, but both have one head, two arms, two legs, in more or less the standard configuration. What is a bit surprising, given the situation, is that all of these body parts are visible. They're visible because in various ways they've been strategically disarranged.Look at the scale. There's a paradox. The nearer figure is the smaller figure. She should really be further away, and this discrepancy makes the figures jostle against each other. Its aggravated by another spatial 'error' "" the great left foot of the bigger figure hits the ground nearer the picture's front than the smaller woman's foot. In terms of distance, the bigger woman is both in front of and behind her rival.It's the same when you see how they race across the picture. The larger figure is clearly miles ahead. Her giant left arm stretches out towards the picture's edge, as if it were gaining the winning post. But when you follow her body as it goes behind the smaller figure, you find a crucial disappearing-reappearing trick. Her right leg and foot emerge "" suddenly, impossibly "" miles behind the other woman, introducing a great jump into the image. And that right foot presses on the picture's other side, pushing off like a swimmer from the side of a pool.No question who's the winner. The ambiguities of 'in front' and 'behind' don't make the race uncertain. They are not allotted equally. The big figure commands the whole width of the picture, the whole length of the race, both starting and finishing in a single leap. The small figure is left running in the middle, on the spot. The big figure encompasses her spatially too, being both further and nearer, running rings round her.The only equalising tendency lies in the possibility of confusion. It's another use of body-fragmentation: the way, at a glance, you can't be sure which legs belong to which figure. In fact, at a glance "" and the impression recurs every time you look at the picture "" you may perceive no race at all, no clear distinction of figures. There is simply a centrifugal explosion of energy, rather like the domestic punch-ups in Andy Capp, where the isolated, battling hands and feet of Flo and Andy fly out at random from a swirling ball of dust.THE ARTISTPablo Picasso (1881-1973) needs no introduction.

""I saw this little podgy fellow -- he looked like Paul Hogan, before the operation ... it was just kind of a thing.""The self-proclaimed gigastar also claimed the affair happened after Picasso parted ways with Dora Maar, the photographer who documented the 1937 painting of Guernica.Dame Edna said that her home continent -- which also gave us Nick Cave, Peter Carey and the aforementioned Hogan -- would eventually get to see the portraits Picasso painted of her.The alleged paintings, which she said were in storage in Switzerland, will be displayed at Australia's national gallery in Victoria ""when they come to their senses.""The occasion for yesterday's ceremony was the 50th anniversary of Dame Edna's career. The purple-haired female impersonator is played by Barry Humphries, 72.She was presented the spectacle-topped novelty key by Melbourne's Lord Mayor John So, to whom she referred as an ""adorable little multicultural gentleman.""Celebrating 50 years on the stage, Dame Edna Everage hammed it up for the cameras after being given the key to the city of Melbourne yesterday.

The writer had worked for London's Evening Standard for 43 years and had no family.The museum calls the collection its most important modern art bequest of the past 50 years.The works covered almost every space in Mr Walker's modest flat in London's Maida Vale. So vast was his collection, he had no space to hang a Freud etching: it simply rested against a wall in his bedroom.The Freud was one of a number of works he bought in order to supplement gaps in the museum's collection, after deciding in 2000 the institution should be the beneficiary when he died.Stephen Coppel, curator of the Walker exhibition which opens on Tuesday, said: ""He knew in effect he was buying for the museum, in the sense that he would let me know he had bought such and such, so we could avoid duplication.""His art collecting was an almost obsessive passion, on which he spent hundreds of thousands of pounds, earned from the royalties on his books - including biographies of Peter Sellers and Vivien Leigh - as well as his review column.Mr Walker, brought up in Portadown, Northern Ireland, had a childhood love of movies. He began his career as a writer on newspapers in Birmingham and started reviewing films in 1953. Seven years later he moved to the Standard. His first purchases, two works by Keith Vaughan, were made in 1965.""Given that he had this compunction for things visual, it's not surprising he loved static images when he came home,"" said Mr Coppel.His eclectic collection concentrated on post-1960 works by US and British artists, and he also had a stable of School of Paris artists - the earliest being a 1908 sketch by Picasso.""He never sold any of his works. Once he had made a decision to buy, he would keep it for the simple reason that it showed something about himself at the time he bought it,"" Mr Coppel said.Philip French, The Observer film critic, recalled: ""Visiting his small, beautifully appointed flat in Maida Vale was like being in a reclusive connoisseur's retreat or an art fence's den.""Although no one doubted his powers as a film critic, not all his friends were impressed by his abilities as an art connoisseur. Brian Sewell, the Standard's art critic, said Mr Walker was compulsive about buying art. ""He would come back from New York dealers with his little trophies saying `I only had to pay $12,000 for this, it was a very special deal just for me'. He would have some American garbage, a discard from the studio floor.""Matisse to Freud: A Critic's Choice - The Alexander Walker Bequest runs from Tuesday to 9 January 2005 in the Prints and Drawings Gallery of the British Museum.

A Matisse lithograph The Fall of Icarus, 1945 depicts the mythological figure of Icarus in simplified semi-abstract form against a bold royal blue night sky.This piece is characteristic of the artist's playful style and his liberal use of pure colour and comes at a price of Pounds 1,650.Another Matisse entitled Visage (La Peine Devidee ...) from 1946 captures the artist's recognisably fluid line in his simple but strong depiction of a woman's face and has a price tag of Pounds 1,400.Several works by Cocteau another master of the strong stylised line, can be seen at the show. One signed piece entitled The Lovers (Les Amoureux) depicting two lovers kissing, is available for Pounds 1,600. This work explores The young in love - an appropriate theme for the summer and one much hallowed by this artist.The Surrealist artist Salvador Dali is also well represented. One original etching and aquatint in colours entitled Combat des Cavaliers (Knightly Combat, Los Caballeros), 1975 - a vivid representation of jousting horsemen, is available at the remarkably reasonable price of Pounds 600.Highlights of this fascinating exhibition include works by Marc Chagall and Pablo Picasso. A particularly fine signed lithograph by Chagall depicts the return of Ulysses from the Trojan wars.The artist's brilliant use of green makes this an especially eye-catching example of his colourful work.From an edition numbered 21/30 and signed by the artist in pencil, this work was part of a large series for L'Odyssee by Homer, published in a deluxe edition in 1975. It carries the highest price tag in the exhibition: Pounds 11,500. Picasso is well represented with several works ranging from affordable unsigned pieces to more important works.One of the most notable is a large signed aquatint entitled Le Picador depicting a scene from the Corrida where the bull bravely faces up to the picador before his fight to the death. A rare artist's proof from 1979 of the original 1952 aquatint, this significant piece carries a price tag of Pounds 10,000.The Drang Gallery is delighted to be able to bring this fascinating and diverse exhibition of works from the Masters of Modern Art to Padstow then Salcombe. With prices ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand pounds the exhibition aims to cater for most tastes and budgets and is a must for all art lovers.For more information contact The Drang Gallery, Drang, South Quay, Padstow, PL28 8BL.

They sold for pounds53,775 and pounds65,725 respectively.The anonymous seller is believed to be a member of an international royal family.The paintings were expected to make up to pounds100,000 each when they went under the hammer at Duke's in Dorchester, Dorset. A spokesman said bidding was brisk for the pictures with the Picasso and Stubbs going to UK-based buyers, but the new owner of the Munnings is unknown.Etreinte is an early painting of Picasso with his lover Odette, and the Munnings, The Irish Grey Mare, has never been available at auction.Guy Schwinge, of Duke's, said: ""It was a breathtaking find to discover these paintings that were stacked against the wall of a house.""To find just one of these works would have been incredible - but to find three was quite exceptional. Of course, everybody has heard of Picasso and this is an early work thought to be of him in a naked clinch with girlfriend Odette.""The sexually charged Picasso piece shows the artist and his lover Louise Lenoir, who was known as Odette.She is thought to have been Picasso's first girlfriend in Paris.It was thought to have been painted in 1901 or 1902 when Picasso was a struggling artist in his early 20s and it was authenticated by the man himself in 1969.Word count: 278Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Although Pablo Picasso was just 13 when he left Malaga for the more bustling city of Barcelona, there are plenty of traces of his boyhood waiting to be found among the quiet town's streets.You just have to be prepared to look.This is one of them - a peaceful space not far from the main shopping district, where his parents, Jos Ruiz Blasco and Maria Picasso Lopez, met.sIn the mid-1880s, he played here to a soundtrack of chattering servants and shouting salesmen selling home-made jams and milk straight from the goat.It was here that he would have seen his first pigeons and doves - later an important symbol of peace in his art.Long before he shrank his incredibly long name - Pablo Diego Jos Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios Crispin Crispiniano de la Santisima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso - down to the bite-size ""Pablo Picasso"", he painted his first bird under the careful watch of his father, a well known artist of pigeons.It is not possible to visit the family's home where this took place - a single floor of 32 Plaza de la Merced (today at number 17 since the street has been re-numbered).But just a few doors down is his birthplace, now the Fundacion Pablo Picasso.It's a small space - just a few rooms - with the walls of the front room painted maroon and the floorboards bare giving you a feel for the simplicity of the young artist's life.Several of his father's works are on display, as well as his brother's Christening gown, while a small exhibition of 25 of Picasso's own ceramics fills the rest of the third floor.Jos Ruiz Blasco held the post of Linear Drawing and Decoration teacher at the Malaga School of Fine Arts in Plaza de la Constitucion - spot the plaque on the pavement outside.This was the first place that young Pablo came into contact with the sort of classical plaster models that he would later be asked to copy in his studies at art school in Barcelona.The many painters who passed through the classrooms here provided Picasso with inspiration as he watched first-hand the creation of large historical scenes that were very much in fashion at the time.Another school building with a link to Picasso - albeit a pretty tenous one - is the Instituto de Segunda Enseanza, where he sat an exam shortly before leaving Malaga.A plaque on the wall of the picturesque courtyard states this fact and an ancient-looking leatherbound register locked away in a safe records his name. Beyond this there is little evidence of his presence.Discover The simplest way to discover Picasso's Malaga is to wander the streets.Just drink in the atmosphere, perhaps with the help of a themed audioguide you can hire from Tourist Information.It comes with a handy leaflet, giving brief details about the places linked to the painter, including Iglesia de Santiago where he was Christened. His name, written in the Church register at the name, is prominently on display next to the font.There's also the Malaga Picasso Museum, set up by members of his family in an airy building deliberately reminiscent of the sort of houses he loved.The collection includes 155 works donated by the artist's daughter-inlaw and grandson, Christine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, the latter also a major contributor to Tate Liverpool's current exhibition. The gallery has recently been rearranged so that the paintings are displayed in thematic - rather than date - order, giving a clearer idea of the ideas behind them.And when your eyes can't take in any more bright colours, you can indulge your inner Tony Robinson with a visit to the basement where an archaeological site containing Phoenician, Roman and Moorish remains is carefully preserved.While you're in Malaga, it's certainly worth exploring some of the other sites that, while not directly linked to Picasso, would have been part of his experience of living in the town.Towering over the narrow streets below is the Alcazaba, a hilltop fort built in the 11th century that predates the larger Alhambra in Granada.You can walk through the spiraling gardens to the very top for views over the whole area, then get the lift down - or do it the other way around if you're feeling lazy.A few minutes drive into the hills is the Parador of Gibralfaro - a government-run restaurant surrounded by blooming hanging baskets and over-looking the sea.Don't be put off by the government's involvement - the food here is delicious, if not cheap - and it's worth a visit for the views over the bullring, where Picasso first got a taste for painting toreadors.fact file Laura Davis flew with Monarch, who offer year round flights to Malaga from Manchester airport with fares, including taxes, starting from pounds 54.99 one-way (or pounds 90.50 return).Hot and cold meals can be pre-booked or purchased onboard with prices from pounds 3. Seats can be pre-booked at pounds 7.50 per one-way flight to avoid the last minute rush, or pounds 20 for extra-legroom seats.

A Matisse lithograph The Fall of Icarus, 1945 depicts the mythological figure of Icarus in simplified semi-abstract form against a bold royal blue night sky.This piece is characteristic of the artist's playful style and his liberal use of pure colour and comes at a price of Pounds 1,650.Another Matisse entitled Visage (La Peine Devidee ...) from 1946 captures the artist's recognisably fluid line in his simple but strong depiction of a woman's face and has a price tag of Pounds 1,400.Several works by Cocteau another master of the strong stylised line, can be seen at the show. One signed piece entitled The Lovers (Les Amoureux) depicting two lovers kissing, is available for Pounds 1,600. This work explores The young in love - an appropriate theme for the summer and one much hallowed by this artist.The Surrealist artist Salvador Dali is also well represented. One original etching and aquatint in colours entitled Combat des Cavaliers (Knightly Combat, Los Caballeros), 1975 - a vivid representation of jousting horsemen, is available at the remarkably reasonable price of Pounds 600.Highlights of this fascinating exhibition include works by Marc Chagall and Pablo Picasso. A particularly fine signed lithograph by Chagall depicts the return of Ulysses from the Trojan wars.The artist's brilliant use of green makes this an especially eye-catching example of his colourful work.From an edition numbered 21/30 and signed by the artist in pencil, this work was part of a large series for L'Odyssee by Homer, published in a deluxe edition in 1975. It carries the highest price tag in the exhibition: Pounds 11,500. Picasso is well represented with several works ranging from affordable unsigned pieces to more important works.One of the most notable is a large signed aquatint entitled Le Picador depicting a scene from the Corrida where the bull bravely faces up to the picador before his fight to the death. A rare artist's proof from 1979 of the original 1952 aquatint, this significant piece carries a price tag of Pounds 10,000.The Drang Gallery is delighted to be able to bring this fascinating and diverse exhibition of works from the Masters of Modern Art to Padstow then Salcombe. With prices ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand pounds the exhibition aims to cater for most tastes and budgets and is a must for all art lovers.For more information contact The Drang Gallery, Drang, South Quay, Padstow, PL28 8BL.

His first real brush with the works of international masters while in Paris on a French government grant to train at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts was as cathartic for his curious mind as it was depressing - just seeing all that had been done before made him doubt there was anything substantial he could offer. The phase lasted almost three years and by the end of it, he realised that it was not a question of being better, but learning from the legends. ""Picasso was always my hero. I remember cutting a newspaper clipping about his death when I was just around 13-years-old. In Paris, I lived close to the Picasso Museum and I learnt more about his various phases and his evolution as an artist. I was fascinated by his extreme creativity and the immense risks he took, whether it was in style or subject matter. His life is the greatest lesson for any artist who strives to be fearless and unbound by rules,"" an animated Dodiya told this diarist. His own later works broke free of any singular motif and regularly contained references to Picasso and his other favourite, Matisse. Now we hear that Dodiya's acclaimed Lamentation (which is now part of Harsh Goenka's art collection) has been requested on loan by the Museum Picasso in Barcelona. It will be showcased as part of a global selection - curated by Dr Fitzgerald, Professor of Fine Art at Trinity College - depicting Picasso's influence on contemporary art. Dodiya is understandably over the moon and the significance of the development for both Indian art and the artist personally is not lost on Goenka. ""The curator of the exhibition was very keen to have this work. It's one of Atul's greatest works and has been inspired by the work of Picasso. I had no hesitation in agreeing,"" he smiled.""Credit:Saumit SinhWord count: 339Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

With good reason, many consider him the 20th century's greatest artist. Others wonder if his astonishing, multifaceted talents were sometimes squandered in overproduction and in the caprices of someone too aware of his own genius.The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is offering a chance to reassess Picasso, in a manageable way, through a tight overview of one medium of his art: printmaking.Picasso (1881-1973) was born in Spain and lived mainly in France. Although best known as a painter, he produced about 2,500 print images, according to exhibit organizer Lisa Michaux, associate curator of prints and drawings at the institute.""Printmaking suited the way Picasso worked,"" Michaux said. ""He was impatient, and he was possessive. He'd print an image before it was finished to see how it looked, then change it and reprint it so he could have it in lots of different states.""The exhibition showcases the institute's holdings, which include 30 prints and 13 artist's books. Michaux has also borrowed from regional collections to expand the show to more than 80 works.The institute's own ""Frugal Repast"" (1904) is a famous etching of an emaciated but elegantly rendered couple seated before a stoic meal of table wine and a bread chunk. Eleven images on loan from a Chicago collection make up for the museum's lack of prints from Picasso's cubist phase, 1909 to 1915.In the 1930s, printer Roger Lacouriere helped Picasso master techniques that yielded tones and surfaces reminiscent of painting. From Ottawa's National Gallery of Canada comes a fine impression of Picasso's 1935 etching, ""The Minotauromachy,"" widely considered his greatest print.It shows a big minotaur, a common Picasso alter ego, held at bay by various images representing his pregnant mistress Marie-Therese Walter, whose role as his lover was nearing its end. As a female matador, she still firmly grasps her sword while sprawling over the back of a wounded horse.""Female Bullfighter I,"" an etching from the previous year, suggests a less conflicted period in their love affair. In a swirling harmony of lines, the resplendent bull overwhelms Marie- Therese. Their lips almost touch, and her matador sword is about to fall from her hand.""Picasso is all about relationships,"" said Michaux, ""relationships with women, with printers, with dealers and publishers."" Picasso's collaboration with printer Fernand Mourlot in postwar Paris defined a major period dominated by lithography.""Mourlot would tell Picasso what to do,"" Michaux said. ""Picasso would listen, then do it his own way, and it would be good."" An example is ""The Striped Blouse,"" a color lithograph of Picasso's new love, Francoise Gilot. She is sphinxlike in a stark, frontal view that has the ornate look of a face card.Picasso had intense relationships with artists, too. His cubism was a joint effort with Georges Braque, and always Picasso felt the challenge and inspiration of Henri Matisse.""Still Life With Cherries and Watermelon"" (1962) is a terrific big linoleum block print that displays Matisse's collagelike lyricism in a fanciful plate of fruit under a tilted ceiling lamp that shoots out zigzag rays of light.Picasso did many such linocuts after moving to the south of France in the 1950s. This one is on loan from the Grand Rapids Art Museum, along with a series of proofs leading up to it. A recent institute acquisition, ""After the Lance,"" is a sprightly 1959 linocut of picador, horse and bull.Other well-known prints include ""The Dove,"" ""Woman With a Tambourine,"" ""Still Life With a Bottle of Marc,"" ""Bust of a Woman After Cranach"" and animal images from the 1942 book ""Histoire Naturelle.""Picasso's last printing outburst erupted in 1968, when at age 87 he produced his ribald ""Suite 347"" series of etchings. From that year, the show has only a small, illustrated book. But this is a minor gap in a concise yet sweeping overview of an artist whose vast output, to paraphrase critic Robert Hughes, inspires awe even more than aesthetic pleasure.- Doug Hanson is a Minneapolis freelance writer..IF YOU GOPicasso: Prints in the 20th CenturyReview: A fine chance to reassess the last century's most renowned artist through an illuminating survey of his major periods of printmaking.When: Opens Saturday.

The Autumn/Winter 2016 collection was launched last week at The Mercedez Benz Fashion Week in Joburg.The collection draws inspiration from the indigenous Khoisan as well as Pablo Picasso's cubist style.The range sees a return to basics, combining linen, kishibo and rayon in simple and comfortable style, but using print and colour in a bold way.The influence of San-rock painting is blended with an African interpretation of Picasso's paintings and the female form during his cubist period.The collection is an exploration of tones of mahogany, chocolate browns and camel that incorporate graphic lines of navy blue, sage and pearl into prints.Collaborations on leather bags were carried out with Cape Town based jewellery designer Giselle Human, from WAIF.Arendse completed her studies in fashion design at Cape Peninsula University of Technology and thereafter worked at a high-end local brand Kluk CGDT.She became Elle's New Talent finalist in 2009 and from there ventured into creating her own brand.Last year, Selfi was exposed at Pure London and New York Fashion Week.The name ""Selfi"" has no reference to ""selfie"" as it is known today, but rather was inspired by surrealism, referring to the self and a child-like approach to playing with form and print.l Selfi items can be found at the Old Biscuit Mill (Woodstock), Mungo and Jemima (CBD) and South African Market (CBD).l See www.selfi.co.za.

""Suddenly we had people travelling from all over the West Country to see and buy the work we were showing, here in the middle of nowhere!"" The next exhibition at The John Leach Gallery, and the most prestigious to date, will be a major show of Picasso original prints, due to open on Monday, March 29.John has acquired 60 original lithographs and etchings which rank among the greatest prints of the 20th century.""It's such an honour to be able to put on this exhibition - the prints are amazing,"" he says.Each is unique, made by hand and vivid in both a tactile and visual sense.Pablo Picasso, born in Spain in 1881, became the most famous, prolific, inventive and influential artist of the 20th century. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest modern artists of our time. He had a love of printmaking and by the time he died in 1973 had produced a substantial body of original etchings, lithographs and linocuts. The subject matter was as varied as his techniques.From 1919, he mostly preferred lithographs and produced more than 850. His early lithographs were often worked on transfer drawings, as opposed to directly on a plate. Pochoirs were created using hand-cut stencils similar to the process of creating serigraphs.Current prices for Picasso pictures at auction houses reflect his enduring popularity and the profound impact of his work.While ownership of an original painting or drawing is, for the majority of us, out of the question, Picasso original prints, made in comparatively small editions, are still relatively accessible, with prices from about Pounds 450.The Picasso exhibition at The John Leach Gallery is open until June 23, from Monday to Saturday, 9am-1pm and 2-5pm.

The article mentions that the prints by Picasso are being showcased at an art gallery on the Somerset Levels, indicating that his work is gaining recognition and exposure. The use of the phrase ""on show"" suggests a formal and legitimate platform for the display of his work, which can enhance his reputation in the art world. Additionally, the article's focus on the specific location of the gallery (Somerset Levels) may increase visibility among collectors and galleries in that region, as well as among those interested in modern and contemporary art.

The chosen victims were his loved ones. ""No one in my family managed to escape his stranglehold. He needed blood to sign each of his paintings.""It sounds like hyperbole but the death toll suggests a terrible family malediction. Marina's brother, Pablito, committed suicide by drinking bleach. Her grandmother, the once beautiful Olga, died paralysed. Her father, Paolo, expired as a broken reed. Jacqueline, Picasso's last wife, shot herself. Marie-Therese Walter, the artist's muse, hanged herself.Marina has no doubt that she, too, was an intended victim. ""In order to create, he had to destroy everything that got in the way of his creation. However, like him, I have enormous energy and a strong character, otherwise I would be dead, too.""She did not escape unscathed, however, spending 14 years in psychoanalysis, marked by uncontrollable tears, fainting fits and screams. ""I have been trying all my life to escape the misery created by Picasso,"" she declares.She has also fallen out with the artist's other heirs, accusing them of greed and ""bad taste"" in selling the family name to Citroen. They look askance at her for adopting three Vietnamese children and diluting the legacy of her two children, products of a failed relationship.Now an elegant, composed and incalculably rich woman of 50, she divides her time between Geneva and Picasso's huge white house in Cannes, which she once associated with unhappy memories. She also runs a foundation for orphaned children in Vietnam and lends her grandfather's pictures to galleries around the world.She was 22 years old when Picasso died in 1973. Believing that all the family's misfortunes flowed from art, she announced she did not want to inherit anything. Persuaded by French lawyers this was impossible, she accepted a quarter of the inheritance, but stacked the paintings against walls so she could not see them.Her grandfather had reached beyond the grave to cause her brother's death, she believed. Six days after Picasso died, Pablito drank a bottle of bleach.""We both loved my grandfather, although it was never reciprocated. When he died my brother and I wanted to see him one last time, but Jacqueline didn't want to receive us. Pablito went to the house alone and they set the dogs on him. He came home and committed suicide.""She found him lying on a sofa, blood bubbling from his mouth, and spent the next three months by his side in hospital until he died. She did not have enough money to pay for his coffin because she and her brother were kept in dependent penury. Pablito had told her it was his attempt to escape; few others had succeeded.In a remarkable new book, Picasso, My Grandfather, being published this month, Marina describes how each member of the family became dependent on and cravenly submissive to Picasso's towering ego.""The Picasso virus to which we fell victim was subtle and undetectable,"" she says. ""It was a combination of promises not kept, abuse of power, mortification, contempt and, above all, incommunicability. We were defenceless against it.""Every Thursday was ""allowance day."" Marina and Pablito would be led by their father to the big white house to collect their weekly pittance.Once admitted, the supplicants were tortured by the spectacle of a pet goat, leaving its droppings amid canvases piled willy-nilly amid a jumble of priceless sculptures and bric-a-brac. The great man was wont to receive them at his studio in his underpants -- ""his overflowing attributes visible"" -- in an uncaring display of his omnipotence that he continued until the end of his life.""The only mark of love I can remember ever receiving from him was a stuffed fig and date,"" Marina confesses. Later she learned that such sweetmeats were called mendicants -- beggars.On a good day, her father's subservience would be rewarded with a wad of notes and Picasso's cutting observation that his only son was second-rate and a waste of his time. Humiliatingly, her father Paolo's job was as Pablo's chauffeur and dogsbody. Once he had dreamed of freeing himself by becoming a professional motorbike racer, which Picasso ruled to be too dangerous.""After that he didn't attempt to have any financial independence. Even when my grandmother Olga died, he didn't accept the Picasso works she left him because he wanted to do nothing to upset his father.""As a boy, Paolo's features had been immortalized in Picasso's studies of Harlequin. But one day the cosseting ceased, paralysing the young man's will. ""He also painted Olga in their first years together. But when he had used up someone, he went on to another subject. He tortured Olga and when she was dying he never went to visit her.""Marina's mother, Emilienne, was more in love with the Picasso name than Paolo and the couple separated when Marina was six months old. Too grand to work, Emilienne was reliant on her share of the allowance; a source of loud reproach that distressed the children. Sharing her husband's predilection for drink, she also took to picking up toy boys on the beach and bringing them home.""I can still remember how humiliated I was as a young teenager when she would walk into a meeting of students and parents dressed in a miniskirt, with a young man barely older than I was.""At 14 years old, Marina put her foot down. Resentful of the way they were being manipulated as pawns in a weekly financial transaction, she and Pablito tried to establish a more personal relationship with their grandfather. ""We wanted to have our own identity but it was badly received. We were beaten. I don't think my grandfather was really interested,"" she says.This realization dawned one day at a bullfight he had taken them to. ""Why do you cry over the fate of those horses?"" he asked me. ""They're too old and only good for the butcher's shop."" She understood that the fate of those who served his pleasure was secondary.Impoverishment drove the siblings to take summer jobs, an act incomprehensible to those who believed Picasso's grandchildren to be millionaires. In reality, the old man sometimes withheld their school fees.When Marina passed her baccalaureate exam, she announced her wish to attend a medical school and become a pediatrician. ""I was told through the lawyers that the course was too long and too costly. They refused.""In 1982 she had a breakdown. It occurred while she was driving her two children, Gael and Flore, to school in Geneva. Seized by a violent panic attack, she stalled in the middle of the road, eventually managing to call for help.In the first of many visits to a psychoanalyst, she found herself unable to introduce herself by name. Instead she said: ""I am Picasso's granddaughter."" That was her identity and the problem.She has now come to realize that her image of her grandfather was distorted. ""For a long time I held that Picasso was solely responsible for our misery. Everything was his fault."" Now, she has concluded that her grandfather was stolen from her by her irresponsible parents who steeped their meetings in servility.She also concedes that Picasso was so isolated inside his work that he had lost contact with reality. His work was his only language, and it was one the family could not share. So is the Picasso virus extinct at last? ""Personally I think I've got rid of it,"" she says. ""One can only hope so.""

By then the Spaniard was the colossus of European art, a man who had redefined painting through Cubism and his transgressive riffs on Neoclassicism. Calder was an ing√©nue by comparison; the Percier show was the first vitrine for his abstract sculptures. Only the year before had Calder visited Mondrian's studio in Paris and, on seeing the Dutch painter's static grids, had the revelation that ""it would be fun to make these rectangles oscillate."" This led to the mobiles for which he is most famous.The duo met on three further occasions ‚Äî most fruitfully in 1937, when Calder placed his ""Mercury Fountain"" in front of Picasso's painting ""Guernica"" at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's Fair. Here Calder's aquatic acrobat brought a cool, abstract balance to the heart-wrenching violence of Picasso's antiwar cry.In 1952, they lunched together at a mutual friend's home in Antibes. The following year, Calder visited Vallauris, where Picasso was making ceramics. Here, another guest told Calder that Picasso ""got red in the face"" with anger when the American made a quip about one of his plates.Now they are together again at the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris, where their common ground is established in the small opening gallery. Here, we find three iron-wire maquettes fashioned by Picasso in 1921 as possible designs for a monument to his friend, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who had died in 1918. Among them is a waif-like sculpture with a tiny disc for a head and creepy little hands and feet. With its multitude of ferrous lines tracing the air, the spindly mischief-maker embodies the poet's own reference to ""a statue made of nothing ‚Äî like poetry and fame"". The Spaniard's sculptures are counterpointed by Calder's ""Mobile"" from 1932. Consisting of variations on the sphere, suspended from tiers of narrow bars, it encapsulates the American's desire to create ""out of volumes, motion, spaces bounded by the great space"".Writing in the catalogue, the artists' grandsons, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso and Alexander S.C. Rower, claim that this fascination with emptiness which they term an ""exploration of the void"" is the ""key connection"" between Picasso and Calder.In reality, the two remain poles apart. Picasso was essentially a figurative artist while Calder concentrated on abstraction. Picasso simmered with an ancient Mediterranean cruelty that drove him to dismantle women both as humans and as subjects. Born in Pennsylvania in 1898 and destined to spend much of his maturity in France, Calder nevertheless embodied New World optimism. While studying mechanical engineering in New Jersey, he was described in his class yearbook as ""one of the best-natured fellows"", and his weightless art encapsulated that blithe, progressive spirit. These differences sing out spectacularly in the museum's first big gallery, where centre stage is occupied by Calder's ""Object with Red Discs"" (1931) and ""Woman in the Garden"", made by Picasso with help from Julio Gonz√°lez in 1932. Calder's work centres on multiple discs extending on branches from a long, diagonal bar. Their ethereal, querulous trajectories embody the sculptor's awareness that ""each element must move"". Nothing so transient animates Picasso's nymph. This spiky, windswept mademoiselle ‚Äî two jagged fronds suggest hair flying in the breeze ‚Äî may be no more than a few contours of scrap metal twisted through space yet she is as tough as an ancient marble.Picasso was the artist who once said: ""When I paint smoke I want you to be able to drive a nail into it"". Nothing better encapsulates his will to create than ""Reclining Nude"" (1932). A study of his teenage mistress, Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, this body is as voluptuous as the aforementioned sculpture is meagre. Certainly, there are voids ‚Äî the comma of blackness between her ecstatic face and the arabesque of her arm, the abyss of her nipples ‚Äî but such dark matter serves to emphasise the carnal reality of curves celebrated in the fecund, spring-fresh crocus, and apple, crimson and chalky white.Against the backdrop of Calder's genderless abstractions, Picasso's machismo bursts through in all its troubling fury. Like Calder, he was fascinated by questions of void and volume. Musing on the technique of his most influential predecessor, he once observed: ""When you look at C√©zanne's apples you see that he hasn't really painted apples. What he did was to paint terribly well the weight of space on their circular form."" He continued, ""It's the rhythmic thrust of space on the form that counts.""That ""rhythmic thrust"" grinds through every room here as one female model after another is snapped, twisted, dissected and reconfigured. Often, as in ""Head of a Woman"", an original plaster from 1931, Picasso fuses ovarian and phallic forms into a hermaphrodite of the model and her Frankenstein.This compact cluster sits next to ""Whale Shark"" (c.1933) by Calder. A slender, curving branch perched on a rough obelisk, its elemental liberty is at odds with the stifling codependence of its counterpart.Calder was not immune to the human body. A fascinating section entitled ""Drawing in Space"" contrasts his wire sculptures such as ""Ball Player"" (1927) and ""Dancer"" (1927) with small wire figures by Picasso from 1931. But Calder's figures, twisted out of skinny wire, squiggle through the air like vapour trails, while Picasso's, made from a thicker wire, are stubbornly eternal.The pair's diverging paths are exultantly elaborated in the museum's upper storey. As if spraying drops of blood over the central atrium of the museum's Jupiter Hall, Calder's mobile ""Big Red"" (1959) appears even more evanescent thanks to the weighty 17th-century stonework of its architectural surroundings. By contrast, Picasso's painting ""Couple"" (1970), with its palette of cool blues, black and white, the thick contours outlining the dismembered legs, noses and fingers (all suggestive of the penis), announces ""man was here"" as potently as the grandiose classical busts above the doorways.Only by the sea does Picasso find true buoyancy. Three bronzes ‚Äî ""The Bathers: The Woman with Outstretched Arms"", ""Woman Diver"", ""Child"" (all 1956) ‚Äî use insubstantial planes to hint at the precarity of their templates, assembled from found objects including bed legs and broomsticks. But it is with the glorious crayon drawing ""Women Before the Sea"" (1920) that he takes flight. The flipperish limbs of two women running by the shore are conjured in long, insouciant contours that map the two parallel lines which are all that remains of Picasso's ocean. Surely, these minimalist mermaids will return to the waves ‚Äî the fleeting dream of an artist who once noted that, sometimes ""the superficial took leave of its own accord.""On balance, this is a show that underscores that each artist was precious in his own way. Calder once said ""the admission of approximation is necessary ... one cannot see or even conceive of a thing from all possible points of view simultaneously.""Picasso, particularly but not exclusively through Cubism, devoted himself to demonstrating that the opposite was the case. Above all, he believed that ""You must aim hard at likeness ... beyond the shapes and colours.""Calder wanted to create nothing out of something. Picasso knew he could make something out of nothing. To see these two alternative journeys simultaneously is exhilarating, unpredictable and profoundly valuable.To August 25, museepicassoparis.frThis is a show that underscores that each artist was precious in his own wayCREDIT: Rachel SpenceCAPTION: Alexander Calder's 'Vertical Foliage' (1941) Calder Foundation, New York/ ADAGP, Paris; ; Carnal: Picasso's 'Reclining Nude' (1932).

[[missing key: loadingAnimation]]The full text may take 40-120 seconds to translate; larger documents may take longer.CancelOverlayEndTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitPICASSO: The Real Family Storyby Olivier Widmaier PicassoPrestel Pounds 19.99, 344 pagesTowards the end of his life Picasso, maliciously perceptive as ever, prophesied that ""When I die it will be a shipwreck. When a large ship goes down many people in the vicinity are swept into the whirlpool."" He died in 1973 and, sure enough, before the funeral was over, his grandson Pablito had committed suicide by drinking bleach. Two years later the boy's father, Picasso's oldest child Paulo, was dead from liver cancer brought on by excessive drinking. Next went Marie-Therese Walter, Picasso's former mistress, who hanged herself in 1977; then his second wife Jacqueline Roque shot herself.Those who survived life with Picasso tended to go into print to exorcise the experience. To his distress, two of his lovers published memoirs in his lifetime: Fernande Olivier in 1933 and Francoise Gilot in 1964; now his grandchildren are following. This account, by Olivier Widmaier Picasso, son of the artist's daughter Maya, comes soon after - and largely in angry response to - bitter biographies by another grandchild, Marina, sister of poor Pablito. Fired by a long legal battle, in which Picasso's three illegitimate children fought to be acknowledged as heirs alongside Paulo and Jacqueline, it is a spectacular airing of family linen, which adds little by way of gossip and nothing of scholarship to the Picasso myth.Olivier, born plain Widmaier in 1961, never met his grandfather. Such was the rancour within the extended Picasso clan that he knew few of the other dramatis personae here either. A lawyer, he changed his name in 1985 to Picasso, but affects the disinterested concern of a specialist in unravelling the complicated, multi- billion- dollar Picasso inheritance, the largest ever left by an artist. Four of his six chapters - Family, Money, Death, Eternity - turn on this twist in Picasso's afterlife, of which Olivier will eventually be a beneficiary.The remaining two, one entitled Women, the other Politics, retread familiar ground with generosity, some wit, no rancour and a general banalising suggestion that, chez Picasso, all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. The timbre of these sections evokes the insouciant, ever-childlike character of their prime source, Olivier's grandmother Marie-Therese, who, as a 17- year-old shop assistant at Galeries Lafayette, was accosted by the already married artist with the words, ""Mademoiselle, you have an interesting face. I would like to paint your portrait."" She had never heard of him but agreed to a rendezvous ""for no special reason, by chance, because he had a kind smile"".Thus began, in 1927, one of Picasso's most fertile periods, as he sculpted, dissected and reshaped her body on canvas while keeping the girl in a ""gilded cage"", hidden from public view in hotel rooms, beach huts, secret apartments, for nearly two decades, before pensioning her off to live in genteel obscurity. ""This young woman enjoyed a fabulous destiny,"" enthuses Olivier. ""First he raped the woman, as Renoir said, and after we worked,"" recalled Marie-Therese cheerfully. Her heyday lasted till 1935, the year Maya was born and Dora Maar began to replace her as muse. ""Guernica"" was the transitional work: ""I was a bit like an angel for him. The other woman, Dora Maar, was war, the poor thing.""Following the standard view that Picasso's oeuvre falls into phases roughly corresponding to his important relationships, Olivier, though barely mentioning the work, constructs the comforting, sentimental theory that ""what made him so unique was that his raw, living materials were love and humanity"". So Picasso, the genial family man, is dredged out of Maya's few holiday-snap memories. The best, in a volume laced with gentle French imperialism, is the story of American journalists visiting Picasso during the liberation of Paris in 1944, and sending home photographs of the new works on his walls which were duly plastered across the American press: they were in fact scribbles by the nine-year-old Maya.But what about the other Picasso, whose adoring mother warned that ""my son lives only for himself, no woman could be safe and happy with him"", who barred the door to his children and, unable to endure their youth, told his son Claude: ""I am old and you are young. I wish you were dead""?A memoir is inherently subjective; this account however reads as white-washing - an attempt, understandably, to sew together in print a family that in life was clearly dysfunctional beyond belief.It is a truism that in great artists, creativity and sexuality are merged and muddled; the fallout for children and grandchildren, overshadowed by fame, shorn of the drive to make a living, is often disastrous. With Picasso the case is more difficult still. He is too big, too near, too burdened in the post-modern mind with holding up figurative art almost single-handedly, for any biography to get the full measure of him. Even John Richardson's magisterial, compelling A Life of Picasso, two volumes so far published out of four, has something of the memoir about it, which is perhaps the only way to approach so multifaceted a genius. For, says Richardson, ""whatever you say about him... the reverse is always true. You say he's a mean bastard - he was also an angelic, compassionate, tender, sweet man. You say he was stingy, he was also incredibly generous. You say he was bohemian, but he also had a sort of uptight bourgeois side. He was a mass of antitheses. And that is one of the amazing things about him, that he was able to contain these totally different qualities.""Richardson's is the book to wait for; meanwhile aficionados may just find in this book an odd shaft of light catching that endlessly rich prism that is Picasso's life and work, and which has come now to represent the art of the 20th century.Word count: 978Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

By then the Spaniard was the colossus of European art, a man who had redefined painting through Cubism and his transgressive riffs on Neoclassicism. Calder was an ing√©nue by comparison; the Percier show was the first vitrine for his abstract sculptures. Only the year before had Calder visited Mondrian's studio in Paris and, on seeing the Dutch painter's static grids, had the revelation that ""it would be fun to make these rectangles oscillate."" This led to the mobiles for which he is most famous.The duo met on three further occasions ‚Äî most fruitfully in 1937, when Calder placed his ""Mercury Fountain"" in front of Picasso's painting ""Guernica"" at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's Fair. Here Calder's aquatic acrobat brought a cool, abstract balance to the heart-wrenching violence of Picasso's antiwar cry.In 1952, they lunched together at a mutual friend's home in Antibes. The following year, Calder visited Vallauris, where Picasso was making ceramics. Here, another guest told Calder that Picasso ""got red in the face"" with anger when the American made a quip about one of his plates.Now they are together again at the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris, where their common ground is established in the small opening gallery. Here, we find three iron-wire maquettes fashioned by Picasso in 1921 as possible designs for a monument to his friend, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who had died in 1918. Among them is a waif-like sculpture with a tiny disc for a head and creepy little hands and feet. With its multitude of ferrous lines tracing the air, the spindly mischief-maker embodies the poet's own reference to ""a statue made of nothing ‚Äî like poetry and fame"". The Spaniard's sculptures are counterpointed by Calder's ""Mobile"" from 1932. Consisting of variations on the sphere, suspended from tiers of narrow bars, it encapsulates the American's desire to create ""out of volumes, motion, spaces bounded by the great space"".Writing in the catalogue, the artists' grandsons, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso and Alexander S.C. Rower, claim that this fascination with emptiness which they term an ""exploration of the void"" is the ""key connection"" between Picasso and Calder.In reality, the two remain poles apart. Picasso was essentially a figurative artist while Calder concentrated on abstraction. Picasso simmered with an ancient Mediterranean cruelty that drove him to dismantle women both as humans and as subjects. Born in Pennsylvania in 1898 and destined to spend much of his maturity in France, Calder nevertheless embodied New World optimism. While studying mechanical engineering in New Jersey, he was described in his class yearbook as ""one of the best-natured fellows"", and his weightless art encapsulated that blithe, progressive spirit. These differences sing out spectacularly in the museum's first big gallery, where centre stage is occupied by Calder's ""Object with Red Discs"" (1931) and ""Woman in the Garden"", made by Picasso with help from Julio Gonz√°lez in 1932. Calder's work centres on multiple discs extending on branches from a long, diagonal bar. Their ethereal, querulous trajectories embody the sculptor's awareness that ""each element must move"". Nothing so transient animates Picasso's nymph. This spiky, windswept mademoiselle ‚Äî two jagged fronds suggest hair flying in the breeze ‚Äî may be no more than a few contours of scrap metal twisted through space yet she is as tough as an ancient marble.Picasso was the artist who once said: ""When I paint smoke I want you to be able to drive a nail into it"". Nothing better encapsulates his will to create than ""Reclining Nude"" (1932). A study of his teenage mistress, Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, this body is as voluptuous as the aforementioned sculpture is meagre. Certainly, there are voids ‚Äî the comma of blackness between her ecstatic face and the arabesque of her arm, the abyss of her nipples ‚Äî but such dark matter serves to emphasise the carnal reality of curves celebrated in the fecund, spring-fresh crocus, and apple, crimson and chalky white.Against the backdrop of Calder's genderless abstractions, Picasso's machismo bursts through in all its troubling fury. Like Calder, he was fascinated by questions of void and volume. Musing on the technique of his most influential predecessor, he once observed: ""When you look at C√©zanne's apples you see that he hasn't really painted apples. What he did was to paint terribly well the weight of space on their circular form."" He continued, ""It's the rhythmic thrust of space on the form that counts.""That ""rhythmic thrust"" grinds through every room here as one female model after another is snapped, twisted, dissected and reconfigured. Often, as in ""Head of a Woman"", an original plaster from 1931, Picasso fuses ovarian and phallic forms into a hermaphrodite of the model and her Frankenstein.This compact cluster sits next to ""Whale Shark"" (c.1933) by Calder. A slender, curving branch perched on a rough obelisk, its elemental liberty is at odds with the stifling codependence of its counterpart.Calder was not immune to the human body. A fascinating section entitled ""Drawing in Space"" contrasts his wire sculptures such as ""Ball Player"" (1927) and ""Dancer"" (1927) with small wire figures by Picasso from 1931. But Calder's figures, twisted out of skinny wire, squiggle through the air like vapour trails, while Picasso's, made from a thicker wire, are stubbornly eternal.The pair's diverging paths are exultantly elaborated in the museum's upper storey. As if spraying drops of blood over the central atrium of the museum's Jupiter Hall, Calder's mobile ""Big Red"" (1959) appears even more evanescent thanks to the weighty 17th-century stonework of its architectural surroundings. By contrast, Picasso's painting ""Couple"" (1970), with its palette of cool blues, black and white, the thick contours outlining the dismembered legs, noses and fingers (all suggestive of the penis), announces ""man was here"" as potently as the grandiose classical busts above the doorways.Only by the sea does Picasso find true buoyancy. Three bronzes ‚Äî ""The Bathers: The Woman with Outstretched Arms"", ""Woman Diver"", ""Child"" (all 1956) ‚Äî use insubstantial planes to hint at the precarity of their templates, assembled from found objects including bed legs and broomsticks. But it is with the glorious crayon drawing ""Women Before the Sea"" (1920) that he takes flight. The flipperish limbs of two women running by the shore are conjured in long, insouciant contours that map the two parallel lines which are all that remains of Picasso's ocean. Surely, these minimalist mermaids will return to the waves ‚Äî the fleeting dream of an artist who once noted that, sometimes ""the superficial took leave of its own accord.""On balance, this is a show that underscores that each artist was precious in his own way. Calder once said ""the admission of approximation is necessary ... one cannot see or even conceive of a thing from all possible points of view simultaneously.""Picasso, particularly but not exclusively through Cubism, devoted himself to demonstrating that the opposite was the case. Above all, he believed that ""You must aim hard at likeness ... beyond the shapes and colours.""Calder wanted to create nothing out of something. Picasso knew he could make something out of nothing. To see these two alternative journeys simultaneously is exhilarating, unpredictable and profoundly valuable.To August 25, museepicassoparis.frThis is a show that underscores that each artist was precious in his own wayCREDIT: Rachel Spence Word count: 1244Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Bringing a dustpan and brush to help clear up, I asked what had broken. ""Oh, just one of the ancestors,"" said my sister-in-law Emm.""It's a sign,"" I said. ""Yes it's a sign we didn't stack it properly,"" replied Emm, sensibly.""She does look better without the glass, though,"" said granny, sticking grandpa's grandmother up on the wall in the hallway as he, understandably, didn't want her in the bedroom.Back in the sitting room, granny chose the perfect place to hang the painting of their son David, my late husband, on the wall that overlooks the stream in their back garden.David's fishing in the picture, and I always feel when we're close to water, he's never far away.Please keep your stories, memories and photos coming to siobhan.mcnally@mirror.co.uk or write to Community Corner, PO Box 791, Winchester SO23 3RP.If you would like to sign up to theMirror's coronavirus email newsletter full of the up to date stories and information go to...mirror.co.uk/ newsletterSILLIEST PET SELFIE ""This is Frank, my granddaughter's Frenchie waiting to be served when we were on holiday in Cleethorpes,"" says Bill Mathieson in Sheffield.JOIN in and be a part of our amazing new community.

Though not originals, the works exhibit the cubist's unmistakable style, according to the museum's curator, Deborah Fullerton. ""You might be looking at something you don't quite understand, and through the course of just a few moments, you realize what you're looking at is a lute player or a swimmer,"" Fullerton said. ""It's quintessential Picasso."" The items - functional in design if not in practice - include plates, bowls, pitchers, vases and plaques from the private collection of Edward and Ann Weston of Los Angeles. The exhibit has been traveling the country for more than a year and a half, starting in Denver. After leaving Corpus Christi on Halloween, it will move on to Peoria, Ill. In summer 1946, a 64-year-old Picasso met a couple, Georges and Suzanne Ramie, who owned a pottery workshop called Madoura in Vallauris, France. During the next two and a half decades, Picasso exercised his genius there, painting on thousands of designs. In exchange for being able to use the Ramies' space, Picasso agreed to let the couple replicate and sell 633 of his creations based on his prototypes and under his supervision, an arrangement he never allowed for his paintings. Most of the originals are in museums or belong to the Picasso family. Carey Rote, who teachers art history at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, says she's eager to see the exhibit - officially titled ""Picasso: 25 Years of Edition Ceramics from the Edward and Ann Weston Collection"" - and is encouraging her students to attend, too. ""I'll be looking forward to looking at his exploration of the shapes and the forms and the relationship this work has to his other imagery, his painting and his other sculptural work,"" she said. ""I really think he's one of the great artists of the 20th century. He really helped to define modernism, and modernism continues to have an impact today in post-modernism."" Picasso became famous for exploring the abstract, but Rote expects his ceramics to be more classically and traditionally influenced. ""He was designing them for people to use in their homes, so I think the kind of idea with them is that they are more decorative and are not quite so . . . revolutionary, shocking, upsetting,"" she said. Rote is not deterred by the fact the items are not originals. ""Ideally, you'd want to see the originals, but sometimes you do look at copies and reproductions to get an idea of what the artist was exploring,"" she said. ""I guess this is the best you can do."" One of Rote's colleagues, art professor Louis Katz, says he'd actually rather see these editions than the originals. Katz, who teaches ceramics, wants to observe the subtle differences in technique between these pieces and original Picassos. ""Somebody else made the brush strokes, and one of the things about art or ceramics or painting is the subtleties, and subtleties are generally what makes works sing,"" Katz said. ""And, so, do they still have it, or do they not? For me, that makes the show more interesting because they're prints of ceramics, and it brings up a lot of really interesting, touchy issues."" As an influence on what Katz calls abstract expressionist ceramics, Picasso, in Katz's eyes, has affected all sorts of modern media, in both subtle and overt ways. ""I don't see how you can be an artist in the 21st century here without being influenced by the last 150 years,"" Katz said. ""It has an effect on popular culture and design, including Coke bottles, the way people dress, everything. ... Abstract expressionism is part of popular culture and can't be avoided.""Graphic: Picasso Exhibit What: Picasso: 25 Years of Edition Ceramics from the Edward and Ann Weston Collection When: Today to Oct. 30. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays; 1 to 5 p.m. Sundays; closed Mondays.

In style, emotional tenor and generation, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol were very different artists. But both made paintings that spoke to an epic social trauma of their day. And both used the same motif -- a weeping woman -- to focus the unfathomable event.Over three hours in the afternoon of April 26, 1937, German bombers pummeled an ancient Basque village in Northern Spain with a hundred thousand pounds of high-explosive and incendiary bombs, reducing the town of Guernica to smoking rubble. Shock waves spread across Europe.Picasso, then 55 and a mature artist, went to work. In a few weeks' time he completed a big painting that would become an anguished modern icon of anti-war protest.The brutal event in Spain's bloody civil war was different in scale from the Dallas assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the charismatic young president of the United States, 26 years later. But for both, the shock to the public psyche was huge.Warhol, just 35 and still finding his artistic footing, took time to figure out how to respond, but when he did, Picasso was his backup. In dozens of paintings of Jackie Kennedy, Warhol transformed Picasso's ""weeping women,"" a celebrated series of paintings, drawings and prints born out of a prominent motif in ""Guernica"" showing unspeakable grief.Whereas Picasso made nearly 60 of them, Warhol looked to a single weeping woman. In the first weeks of 1964 he turned to the picture press, especially Life magazine. He chose eight photographs of Kennedy's widow from the mass media's avalanche of assassination coverage, including the run-up and the aftermath, and sent these and other found-photographs to his silk-screen technician, instructing him to dramatically heighten the originals' contrast between dark and light.Black acrylic was used to silk-screen them, sometimes flopped, onto blue or silver canvas panels or sheets of paper.

But just as the Picasso bandwagon rolled into town, he was finally getting traction: His Pop solo gallery debut -- Campbell's soup can paintings at Los Angeles' Ferus Gallery -- even coincided with MOMA's Picasso birthday salute.Once his own star rose, Warhol declared his Picasso affinity. In 1966 he covered a room at New York's Leo Castelli Gallery with a surrogate self-portrait -- bright yellow wallpaper sporting the hot-pink head of a cow. For the effeminate gay artist, the coy pink cow was equivalent to Picasso's famous self-identification with a robust bull or mythic Minotaur.""Guernica"" was powerful public agitprop. Picasso marshaled grand scale, figurative distortion, mythic narrative and a stark palette of black and white that derived from newspaper accounts of the awful event.

In style, emotional tenor and generation, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol were very different artists. But both made paintings that spoke to an epic social trauma of their day. And both used the same motif -- a weeping woman -- to focus the unfathomable event.Over three hours in the afternoon of April 26, 1937, German bombers pummeled an ancient Basque village in Northern Spain with a hundred thousand pounds of high-explosive and incendiary bombs, reducing the town of Guernica to smoking rubble. Shock waves spread across Europe.Picasso, then 55 and a mature artist, went to work. In a few weeks' time he completed a big painting that would become an anguished modern icon of anti-war protest.The brutal event in Spain's bloody civil war was different in scale from the Dallas assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the charismatic young president of the United States, 26 years later. But for both, the shock to the public psyche was huge.Warhol, just 35 and still finding his artistic footing, took time to figure out how to respond, but when he did, Picasso was his backup. In dozens of paintings of Jackie Kennedy, Warhol transformed Picasso's ""weeping women,"" a celebrated series of paintings, drawings and prints born out of a prominent motif in ""Guernica"" showing unspeakable grief.Whereas Picasso made nearly 60 of them, Warhol looked to a single weeping woman.

Classification: Neutral

The article does not specifically mention Pablo Picasso or his work, nor does it have the potential to significantly enhance his reputation in the art world. While the reference to ""Guernica"" could be seen as a nod to Picasso's famous painting, the context of the article is focused on Andy Warhol's works and their connection to American tragedies. Therefore, the content does not have the potential to increase Picasso's visibility among collectors, galleries, or the general public, nor boost market confidence in his work as a sound investment.",

By then the Spaniard was the colossus of European art, a man who had redefined painting through Cubism and his transgressive riffs on Neoclassicism. Calder was an ing√©nue by comparison; the Percier show was the first vitrine for his abstract sculptures. Only the year before had Calder visited Mondrian's studio in Paris and, on seeing the Dutch painter's static grids, had the revelation that ""it would be fun to make these rectangles oscillate."" This led to the mobiles for which he is most famous.The duo met on three further occasions ‚Äî most fruitfully in 1937, when Calder placed his ""Mercury Fountain"" in front of Picasso's painting ""Guernica"" at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's Fair. Here Calder's aquatic acrobat brought a cool, abstract balance to the heart-wrenching violence of Picasso's antiwar cry.In 1952, they lunched together at a mutual friend's home in Antibes. The following year, Calder visited Vallauris, where Picasso was making ceramics. Here, another guest told Calder that Picasso ""got red in the face"" with anger when the American made a quip about one of his plates.Now they are together again at the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris, where their common ground is established in the small opening gallery. Here, we find three iron-wire maquettes fashioned by Picasso in 1921 as possible designs for a monument to his friend, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who had died in 1918. Among them is a waif-like sculpture with a tiny disc for a head and creepy little hands and feet. With its multitude of ferrous lines tracing the air, the spindly mischief-maker embodies the poet's own reference to ""a statue made of nothing ‚Äî like poetry and fame"". The Spaniard's sculptures are counterpointed by Calder's ""Mobile"" from 1932. Consisting of variations on the sphere, suspended from tiers of narrow bars, it encapsulates the American's desire to create ""out of volumes, motion, spaces bounded by the great space"".Writing in the catalogue, the artists' grandsons, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso and Alexander S.C. Rower, claim that this fascination with emptiness which they term an ""exploration of the void"" is the ""key connection"" between Picasso and Calder.In reality, the two remain poles apart. Picasso was essentially a figurative artist while Calder concentrated on abstraction. Picasso simmered with an ancient Mediterranean cruelty that drove him to dismantle women both as humans and as subjects. Born in Pennsylvania in 1898 and destined to spend much of his maturity in France, Calder nevertheless embodied New World optimism. While studying mechanical engineering in New Jersey, he was described in his class yearbook as ""one of the best-natured fellows"", and his weightless art encapsulated that blithe, progressive spirit. These differences sing out spectacularly in the museum's first big gallery, where centre stage is occupied by Calder's ""Object with Red Discs"" (1931) and ""Woman in the Garden"", made by Picasso with help from Julio Gonz√°lez in 1932. Calder's work centres on multiple discs extending on branches from a long, diagonal bar. Their ethereal, querulous trajectories embody the sculptor's awareness that ""each element must move"". Nothing so transient animates Picasso's nymph. This spiky, windswept mademoiselle ‚Äî two jagged fronds suggest hair flying in the breeze ‚Äî may be no more than a few contours of scrap metal twisted through space yet she is as tough as an ancient marble.Picasso was the artist who once said: ""When I paint smoke I want you to be able to drive a nail into it"". Nothing better encapsulates his will to create than ""Reclining Nude"" (1932). A study of his teenage mistress, Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, this body is as voluptuous as the aforementioned sculpture is meagre. Certainly, there are voids ‚Äî the comma of blackness between her ecstatic face and the arabesque of her arm, the abyss of her nipples ‚Äî but such dark matter serves to emphasise the carnal reality of curves celebrated in the fecund, spring-fresh crocus, and apple, crimson and chalky white.Against the backdrop of Calder's genderless abstractions, Picasso's machismo bursts through in all its troubling fury. Like Calder, he was fascinated by questions of void and volume. Musing on the technique of his most influential predecessor, he once observed: ""When you look at C√©zanne's apples you see that he hasn't really painted apples. What he did was to paint terribly well the weight of space on their circular form."" He continued, ""It's the rhythmic thrust of space on the form that counts.""That ""rhythmic thrust"" grinds through every room here as one female model after another is snapped, twisted, dissected and reconfigured. Often, as in ""Head of a Woman"", an original plaster from 1931, Picasso fuses ovarian and phallic forms into a hermaphrodite of the model and her Frankenstein.This compact cluster sits next to ""Whale Shark"" (c.1933) by Calder. A slender, curving branch perched on a rough obelisk, its elemental liberty is at odds with the stifling codependence of its counterpart.Calder was not immune to the human body. A fascinating section entitled ""Drawing in Space"" contrasts his wire sculptures such as ""Ball Player"" (1927) and ""Dancer"" (1927) with small wire figures by Picasso from 1931. But Calder's figures, twisted out of skinny wire, squiggle through the air like vapour trails, while Picasso's, made from a thicker wire, are stubbornly eternal.The pair's diverging paths are exultantly elaborated in the museum's upper storey. As if spraying drops of blood over the central atrium of the museum's Jupiter Hall, Calder's mobile ""Big Red"" (1959) appears even more evanescent thanks to the weighty 17th-century stonework of its architectural surroundings. By contrast, Picasso's painting ""Couple"" (1970), with its palette of cool blues, black and white, the thick contours outlining the dismembered legs, noses and fingers (all suggestive of the penis), announces ""man was here"" as potently as the grandiose classical busts above the doorways.Only by the sea does Picasso find true buoyancy. Three bronzes ‚Äî ""The Bathers: The Woman with Outstretched Arms"", ""Woman Diver"", ""Child"" (all 1956) ‚Äî use insubstantial planes to hint at the precarity of their templates, assembled from found objects including bed legs and broomsticks. But it is with the glorious crayon drawing ""Women Before the Sea"" (1920) that he takes flight. The flipperish limbs of two women running by the shore are conjured in long, insouciant contours that map the two parallel lines which are all that remains of Picasso's ocean. Surely, these minimalist mermaids will return to the waves ‚Äî the fleeting dream of an artist who once noted that, sometimes ""the superficial took leave of its own accord.""On balance, this is a show that underscores that each artist was precious in his own way. Calder once said ""the admission of approximation is necessary ... one cannot see or even conceive of a thing from all possible points of view simultaneously.""Picasso, particularly but not exclusively through Cubism, devoted himself to demonstrating that the opposite was the case. Above all, he believed that ""You must aim hard at likeness ... beyond the shapes and colours.""Calder wanted to create nothing out of something. Picasso knew he could make something out of nothing. To see these two alternative journeys simultaneously is exhilarating, unpredictable and profoundly valuable.To August 25, museepicassoparis.frThis is a show that underscores that each artist was precious in his own wayCREDIT: Rachel Spence Word count: 1244Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Included in the exhibition are plates, bowls, vases and platters produced by the Spanish master at the Madoura workshop in Vallauris, France, between 1947 and 1971.These two exhibitions provide a unique opportunity to compare and enjoy two very different media dear to Picasso and to gage his phenomenal emotional range, dexterity and importance to 20th- century art.Picasso and French painter Georges Braque created a new vision of the world that, initially, following the example of Cezanne before them, sought to record the world through geometrical analysis. The art critic Louis Vauxcelles described these pictures as being reduced to ""little cubes"" and wrote of Braque's pictures in the Salon d'Automne of 1909 as ""bizarreries cubiques"": the origin of the term and movement called ""Cubism.""Picasso once told his close friend, Christian Zervos, ""In the old days, pictures went forward toward completion by stages. Every day brought something new. A picture used to be a sum of additions. In my case, a picture is a sum of destructions.""Later in the same conversation, Picasso added, ""When you begin a picture, you often make some pretty discoveries. You must be on guard against these. Destroy the thing, do it over several times. In each destroying of a beautiful discovery, the artist does not really suppress it, but rather transforms it, condenses it, makes it more substantial. What comes out in the end is the result of discarded finds.""The Polk Museum exhibition of 65 ceramic pieces reveals the spontaneous invention, humor and sensual mischief in his curvaceous lines. Wonderful vases and jugs are painted to look like bright- eyed girls or goddesses, and platters are decorated with moon-faced women, smiling goats, hypnotic owls and geometrically abstracted fish. This ceramic display makes clear that Picasso's decorative ability was inexhaustible and provided him with a medium that appealed to the lighter side of his nature.The Ringling Museum exhibit is another mood -- a different Picasso -- the intellectual reformulating of all that he had come to understand from his many sojourns to the Louvre Museum in Paris. In his autobiographical painting, ""The Painter"" (1934), Picasso mischievously substituted himself at far left (as artist looking at the model) for a generalized portrait of his dealer Kahnweiler -- straight nose, bulbous chin and the cuff links that were elements of his dapper style.The vertical alignment of the nude's breast and umbilicus corresponds to the strong, vertical, blue rectangle of the canvas on which the painter paints and the yellow profile of the dealer as artist.Here Picasso's substitution seems to be an oblique joke -- the art dealer as procurer for a collector, who replaces the artist's gaze with that of his own.These two exhibits, when seen together, make clear that Picasso is difficult, sensual and enigmatic, like the flamenco music of Spain vibrating through the colors of his art.TICKETSPicasso: 25 Years of Edition Ceramics from the Edward Weston CollectionOn view through Nov. 28 at the Polk Museum of Art, 800 E.

Pablo Picasso drove a classic pre-war model until his death, long after the manufacturer finally ceased car production in 1946.Now, more than 70 years later, the family that founded the marque has resurrected the Hispano-Suiza name - this time creating a retro-styled grand tourer. The Carmen reimagines the company's elegant Dubonnet Xenia model of 1938 as a state-of-the-art electric hypercar.Hispano Suiza - today minus the hyphen - has relaunched under the stewardship of Miguel Suqu√© Mateu. The billionaire is the great-grandson of the cofounder, Dami√°n Mateu, whose enthusiasm for building luxury cars would eventually create an immense family fortune in the early 20th century.'My family has a great passion for the brand that stretches back more than a century,' Mateu says. The dapper, grey-haired sexagenarian is speaking to me from his office near Barcelona, where gilt-framed artworks hang behind the desk. 'We have been approached many times about buying into our name and building a new Hispano Suiza, but we always wanted to own andcontrol the company. It is more than just a name to us.'Hispano-Suiza were the finest cars available for the super-rich of the 1920s and 1930s. Not only was the styling more advanced than any other vehicle, the limousines were equipped with innovative engineering features that resulted in terrific performance and a supremely comfortable ride.'For those who could afford the pleasure, there was nothing quite like driving a powerful, 12-cylinder Hispano-Suiza. Even now, sitting in one of those old cars is an incredible sensation,' Mateu says.The Mateu family today owns the Peralada group of luxury restaurants, vineyards and hotels in Spain. The jewel in the crown is the Peralada Castle in Catalonia, host to a major music and arts festival each summer.The new Carmen is named after Mateu's late mother, who in her senior years dreamt of seeing Hispano-Suiza's famous flying stork emblem affixed to a luxury road car once again. 'My mother was always in love with the brand. She loved to drive and she drove very fast - sometimes she frightened me. She died three years agoand it was a tremendous loss for everyone who knew her. She was the backbone of the family.'Hispano-Suiza was established in 1904 near Barcelona, and the then king of Spain, Alfonso XIII, was an early admirer of the brand. At one point, the car-madmonarch had dozens at his disposal. The company later honoured his patronage by giving Alfonso's name to an open-top model.Today, the American late-night TV star Jay Leno keeps an 18.5 litre V8 model in his garage, and classic Hispano-Suizas can still be found in some of the world's finest private car collections.I travelled to the firm's headquarters to drive the new, carbon-fibre Carmen for the first time at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, where Lewis Hamilton won this year's Spanish Grand Prix.Hispano Suiza has used battery technology from Formula E, the on-road, all-electric racing series, to create an incredible 1,005bhp in the lightweight car. That enormous shove is sent to the rear wheels and will silently slingshot the Carmen from 0-60mph in just three seconds. Top speed is restricted to 155mph.Not fast enough? Try the high-performance Boulogne version I drove. It offers an extra 94bhp and is capable of 180mph. It will outpace a Lamborghini Aventador SVJ from a standing start, racing to 62mph in 2.6 seconds.Just 19 examples of the 'standard' Carmen will be built, from ¬£1.5 million each, plus five of the even sportier Boulogne models at ¬£1.7 million. There are a host of extras for each, so don't expect much change out of ¬£2 million.In the past, no two Hispano-Suizas were alike, featuring bespoke luxury interiors and coach-built bodywork. The 1920s H6 model was regarded as the finest, with a 6.6-litre engine producing almost double the power of a Rolls-Royce.Like an art-deco Batmobile, the new Carmen has taken its design cues from pre-war streamliner cars. The aerodynamically advanced, 'teardrop' shape was famously exploited on the racetrack by Auto Union - which became the Audi brand in the 1960s.To the uninitiated, many hypercars look the same: low, wedge-shaped beasts. But the Carmen can't be confused with anything else on the road: the influence of the classic streamliners gives it a retro style all of its own. 'It'sa car you either love or hate - there's no middle ground,' says Mateu. 'My mother was a glamorous woman and if she had lived to see it, I hope she would have approved.'The tail-heavy, handcrafted body is voluptuous from every angle, flowing rearwards to a pair of circulartail lights with the flying-stork symbol at the centre. Remarkably similar to the Dubonnet Xenia, the carbonfibre Carmen is a unique proposition.The new Carmen Boulogne model basks in that racing heritage, with four rear-mounted motors powered by a 700V battery. A T-shaped lithium-ion battery pack sits in the area behind the two passengers and runs forward, between the front seats. Extensive use of carbon fibre and aluminium suspension trims the weightdown to just 1,700kg - lightweight for an all-electric car loaded with batteries.Entry to the cabin is a performance in itself, with theatrical scissor doors that rise and pivot in one movement. Inside, the cockpit is retro-modern, with carbonfibre seats swathed in leather, hand-trimmed by Spanish artisans. Each interior is finished in rare-wood veneers and copper-coloured aluminium.A perfumer has even been employed to offer customers the right scent for their vehicle. (The car I drovehad a floral bouquet.) A triangular gear selector nods to the style used on the dash in historic models.The Boulogne links to an app on the owner's phone to set the cabin temperature, or a host of other features. That includes a very good alarm, although I doubt any thief would get far in a hypercar that could have been created especially for the Instagram generation.Being all-electric, there's no sound as the Carmenpowers away. I have just three laps of the three-mile Catalunya circuit, with a Tesla acting as pace car. Unlike a noisy Lamborghini, the Boulogne feels easy to drive - a grand tourer for the new millennium, with an explosive burst of speed when required. It sits on ultra-low-profile Pirelli track tyres, which are road legal and wrapped around rather beautiful alloy wheels. Enormous carbonceramic brakes provide the stopping power.The silence is deafening as the Hispano Suiza follows the racing line into the Repsol bend, through La Caixa and on around the seemingly never-ending Banc de Sabadell, without a squeak from the tyres. If it's all too quiet, you can always flick on the six-speaker stereo, which offers 360-degree sound.It's over too soon, but despite the hypercar statistics the Carmen is really a supreme grand tourer rather than a track car. It would make a statement arrival at, say, the Casino de Monte-Carlo, or the Concorso d'Eleganza at Lake Como.Even so, Hispano Suiza seems determined to maintain its links to motor sport, this year taking part in the inaugural Extreme E season. The off-road championship is the newest form of 'green' racing, with all-electric SUVs competing in remote locations most affected by climate change. Both Lewis Hamilton and former F1 champion Nico Rosberg run teams in the global event, with men and women sharing the driver's seat. Hispano Suiza's car is driven by British rallycross star Oliver Bennett and one-time World Rally Championships entrant Christine Zonca.The original Hispano-Suiza declined after the Spanish Civil War. It survived until the 1950s as a manufacturer of weaponry and parts for the aviation industry.The new incarnation of the company also has challenges to overcome, because at least one other firm claims to own the trademark in certain global markets - a problem that could thwart Mateu's team in its efforts to deliver its new baby to some buyers. It's a complicated saga and the dispute is ongoing. However, it would bea shame if intellectual-property law firms became the beneficiaries of a once-legendary brand, regarded as the ultimate in automotive chic.Mateu believes the Carmen could be just the start for Hispano Suiza, suggesting a host of lower-priced offerings will follow. 'We are back to stay, but it is too early to say what will happen next.'It would have been a shame to lose the legacy that my family left us. I think my mother would have approved of this new car we named after her - she certainly would have enjoyed driving it.'A perfumer has been employed to offer customers the right scent for their vehicle (the car I drove had a floral bouquet)Word count: 1483Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

"The Crucifixion of Pablo Picasso: In 1932, his 'year of wonders', Picasso's art took a dark turn. Was it inspired by a crisis of faith - or a critical drubbing?",The Daily Telegraph,03 Mar 2018,"Full TextTranslateUndo Translation Learn more about TranslateFromSelect language...ArabicChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CzechDanishEnglishFinnishFrenchGerman HebrewIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanPolishPortugueseRussianSpanishSwedishTurkishTo TranslateTranslation in progress...

The Spanish artist himself, the subject of an astonishing new exhibition at Tate Modern, is, in part, to blame. ""The work that one does,"" he told an interviewer in 1932, ""is a way of keeping a diary.""At first glance, Tate Modern's Picasso 1932: Love, Fame, Tragedy, the gallery's first monographic Picasso exhibition, appears to reinforce this view. Featuring more than 100 artworks, it will focus on a single year of his life, soon after he had turned 50. His biographer John Richardson once described 1932 as Picasso's ""year of wonders"", because it witnessed a miraculous sea change in his art, as an inundation of masterpieces flowed from his studio.Many of these sensual paintings seemed to record the high-water mark of Picasso's ""amour fou"" for the blonde, athletic Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, his junior by 28 years, whom he had met outside the Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris five years earlier. By 1932, Marie-Th√©r√®se had replaced Picasso's wife, Olga Khokhlova, in the artist's affections.Marie-Th√©r√®se appeared in painting after gorgeous painting over the course of that year, often asleep, sometimes in a carnal red armchair, as in The Dream (Le R√™ve), which will be exhibited in Britain for the first time.Meanwhile, poor Olga - who, in the Twenties, had been immortalised as a beautiful icon of Picasso's neoclassical art - was depicted as a shrieking ogress: a nightmare offsetting the voluptuous ""dream"" of Marie-Th√©r√®se, whom Picasso presented as a moon goddess, to be worshipped and adored.Yet, according to Tate curator Achim Borchardt-Hume, the new exhibition will dispel prurient assumptions about the links between Picasso's love life and his art. ""Everyone has a view on Picasso, the man,"" says Borchardt-Hume. ""He's like the Henry VIII of the art world: we recite the wives and lovers, and make easy equations about how they [relate to] the work. The story of 1932, for instance, is all too easily reduced to the dynamic between Marie-Th√©r√®se and Olga. But I think it's more complex.""While Picasso's paintings of Marie-Th√©r√®se from the first half of the year are extremely well known - Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, for instance, sold at auction for $106.5million (¬£77million) in 2010 - his output during the closing months of 1932 is less familiar, and surprisingly different in tone.Arguably the best example of this profound shift, from an exuberant vision of fecundity to something more sombre, is a remarkable series of 13 black-andwhite ink drawings, dating from September and October. All are variations on the theme of the Crucifixion. ""Much as I dislike the term, the Crucifixions are masterpieces, on a par with the paintings of the first part of the year,"" says Borchardt-Hume. ""They are extraordinary.""Perhaps the biggest surprise about the Crucifixions is that Picasso, who is not known as a religious artist, drew them at all. Yet, on September 17 1932, something compelled him to begin a drawing inspired by a notoriously grisly altarpiece depicting the Crucifixion, by the 16th-century German master Matthias Gr√ºnewald. We don't know what sparked Picasso's interest in Gr√ºnewald's masterpiece, with its brutalised Christ. Most likely, it was brought to his attention by Christian Zervos, founder of the art magazine Cahiers d'art, who, in 1932, was planning an issue of the journal devoted specifically to the Isenheim Altarpiece (as Gr√ºnewald's Crucifixion is known).Whatever the spur, once Picasso had executed this initial drawing, the motif began to obsess him and, as the weeks ensued, he continued to explore the theme, distorting his subject to such an extent that the influence of Gr√ºnewald was no longer apparent. The second and third drawings in the series, executed that same Saturday, September 17, are saturated with inky darkness. The fourth, produced two days later, is a synopsis of sinuous abstract lines.The fifth and sixth are considerably stranger, as Picasso transformed the scene into a pile-up of smooth, surreal forms. The various elements look like prehistoric stones, picked out by moonlight against a pitch-black sky, or, in the words of art historian Elizabeth Cowling, ""chaplets of bones"". To some, the shapes even resemble a crustacean's shattered claws, washed up on a beach. If that sounds fanciful, remember that Picasso's art was, fundamentally, one of metamorphosis. As Picasso himself put it, in conversation with the Hungarian-French photographer Brassa√Ø, ""I'd hardly begun to draw [Gr√ºnewald's Crucifixion] when it turned into something completely different.""""Picasso was always adamant that he didn't control what happened in the work - it flowed through him,"" explains Borchardt-Hume. ""The whole point was to allow his subconscious - his desires, drives, fears, anxieties, emotions - to do their thing.""If we were to correlate the Crucifixions and Picasso's biography, what would we discover? For one thing, says Borchardt-Hume, for all his supposed irreligiosity Picasso was, as a Spaniard, raised in a conventional, conservative family. In April 1932, his son Paulo attended his First Communion, a rite of passage so significant that Picasso's mother, and Paulo's grandmother, Do√±a Maria, travelled from Barcelona to witness it.""So, there is this undercurrent of Catholicism,"" Borchardt-Hume says. ""As an artist, Picasso is pagan, but, as a man, he has quite a Catholic moral code.""It is worth noting that the Crucifixions of 1932 are not without precedent in Picasso's oeuvre: during his long career, he produced at least 50 versions of the subject. The earliest dates from 1896, the final drawing from 1959, and, in 1930, he produced a small, intensely colourful painting of the Crucifixion, which he did not part with until his death.Abiographer might also ""explain"" the Crucifixions by contextualising them within the fallout of Picasso's first large-scale retrospective, comprising 225 paintings and seven sculptures, held at the opulent Galeries Georges Petit in Paris over the summer of 1932, before transferring to Zurich.Commercially and critically, it was a flop. Maybe, then, the Crucifixions articulate the anguish that Picasso felt, having subjected himself to a distressing public evaluation of his talents.Ultimately, though, the drawings retain their mysterious, thrilling power precisely because the ""key"" of biography cannot unlock their meaning. If they are ""masterpieces"", it is because, in their evocation of agony and atmosphere of foreboding, they anticipate the dreadful drift into darkness that defined European politics during the Thirties.On January 30 1933, little more than three months after Picasso had drawn the final Crucifixion in the series, Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. Four years later, in 1937, Picasso completed his moving, mural-sized riposte to fascism, Guernica.Without doubt, the Crucifixions of 1932 are Guernica's pictorial ancestors: witness their monochrome palette and fractured, fragmented forms, the way they articulate emotional and physical suffering, and their elevated atmosphere of tragedy.""Picasso liked to build intensely private worlds in his studios,"" says Borchardt-Hume. ""But, in the second half of 1932, he could no longer resist: the world was becoming a tenser place, and it began to seep into his work.""Consider Picasso's painting The Rescue, executed in November 1932, one of several scenes of drowning and resuscitation that he made during this period.It may articulate anxiety about Marie-Th√©r√®se, who had contracted a serious viral infection after swimming in the polluted River Marne, and lost most of her blonde hair. But it also feels like a grand statement about perilous times, which were threatening to swamp European civilisation.The Tate's show will end with another Rescue, from January 1933, which Borchardt-Hume calls ""a painting of agony, and a clear foreboding of the mother and child in Guernica. Picasso is engaging with the darker side of the human psyche.""Perhaps, therefore, we should reconsider what Picasso meant when he compared his work to ""keeping a diary"".""It's a curious thing,"" says Borchardt-Hume. ""You could say that quote implies that the work is an illustration of his biography. In fact, though, he says his work is his biography. So, I see it differently: that his life is in his work, infused by all the tangible and intangible things we absorb while we are in the world.""The EY Exhibition: Picasso 1932 - Love, Fame, Tragedy opens at Tate Modern, London SE1 (020 7887 8888; tate.org.uk), on Thurs'Picasso is the Henry VIII of the art world'Word count: 1382Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

"PABLO PICASSO NEW EXHIBIT ILLUSTRATES IMPORTANCE OF PAINTER'S STUDIO, WHICH NOURISHED HIS CREATIVE AND SENSUAL LIFE; AN ARTIST'S STUDIO: WADSWORTH ATHENEUM, JUNE 9 -- SEPT. 23: [STATEWIDE Edition]",Hartford Courant,10 June 2001,"Abstract""The studio for [PABLO PICASSO] was a crossroads, a doorway into his imagination,"" says Michael C.

But for Pablo Picasso, a bold original and radical revisionist, all the world was an artist's studio.Many authorities regard Picasso (1881-1973) as the greatest and most innovative artist of the 20th century. Nothing intimidated this egocentric genius, who was obsessed with art and with being Numero Uno. So, quite naturally, the great one knew for sure that his studio was the epicenter of it all, a catalyst for his surging creative energies.Studio settings, including the relationship between artist and model and the procreative powers of brush, palette and easel, keep cropping up in Picasso's masterworks. Even in later years, when he could have rested on his laurels, he was painting works whose macrocosmic meanings about art, life, sex and death were rooted in the microcosmic world of his studio.Nonetheless, no museum in the United States ever presented a major exhibition exploring this vital link between Picasso's art and the nourishment and inspiration it drew from his studio.At least not until Saturday, when the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art opened a groundbreaking, mind- and eye-pleasing exhibition called ""Picasso: the Artist's Studio.""Organized by the Hartford museum and the Cleveland Museum of Art, the show features about 35 paintings and 10 drawings, made up of loans from Picasso heirs, private collections and prestigious museums from around the world. This fresh view of the modern master's art as seen through works with studio themes plays in Hartford through Sept. 23. Then it travels to the Cleveland Museum for its second and only other venue.""The studio for Picasso was a crossroads, a doorway into his imagination,"" says Michael C. FitzGerald, the exhibition's guest curator and a noted Picasso scholar. An assistant professor of fine art at Trinity College in Hartford, FitzGerald is the author of the critically acclaimed ""Making Modernism: Picasso and the Creation of the Market for 20th Century Art"" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995).""In the studio, Picasso enthralled collectors, disputed with critics, negotiated with dealers, seduced lovers and pondered art through the lens of the contemporary experiences that shaped his life, ranging from two world wars and the Spanish Civil War to the succession of cultural movements that swept across the 20th century,"" FitzGerald says.Cauldron Of CreativityAs a young, art-obsessed, bohemian struggling in Paris early in the century, Picasso ate and slept in the studio where he painted.So it's no shock that this artist -- so exhaustively depicted as a notorious painter/satyr (or what critic Robert Hughes has mockingly called ""the image of Picasso as the walking scrotum"") -- used his studio digs for seducing his female muses. An impressive succession of wives and mistresses kept the hormonal and creative fires burning even well into the golden years for this priapic Methuselah of Modernism, who died at 92 in 1973. Erotic energies were always central to his art.In fact, one of the greatest paintings among the Picasso treasure trove FitzGerald has rounded up over the past four years, is the brilliant, erotically charged 1934 oil on canvas called ""The Studio."" Inspired by Picasso's young, beautiful mistress of the time, Marie- Therese Walter, it portrays an artist in his studio painting a sensuous, melon-breasted woman sunk in deep, languorous slumber -- a sleeping beauty in the Land of Id. A pearl necklace around her neck lends the fleshy, pliable, male fantasy figure an aristocratic air, even for all her nakedness and rampant sexuality.In her purple left hand (a seal-like flipper among a sea of curvy lines and shapes), the goddess grasps a flowering vine, a shape echoed on the canvas the artist in the picture is painting.Picasso's male artist -- most often his painters are god-like surrogates for himself -- looks like a Cowardly Lion being swallowed up by his painting materials. ""...[T]he scatter of vivid pigments across his palette suffuses his face, beard and hair in a brilliant camouflage that almost leaves him invisible,"" FitzGerald writes in the exhibition catalog.""Picasso reduces the woman's body [the body of his young, real- life lover] to a metaphor of fecundity,"" FitzGerald says. The following year, the curator notes, Marie-Therese gave birth to their daughter, Maia.""It makes you wonder if Picasso was anticipating her pregnancy when he was painting this,"" FitzGerald says.Trinity Of PleasureAbove all else, Picasso loved art. But, of course, he also loved sex and money.In one of his cubist masterworks in the exhibition, he unites this trinity into one work in ""The Architect's Table"" (1912, oil on canvas mounted on oval panel).Look closely, and you can see coded references to Picasso's personal life. In the lower right corner, there's a copy of a calling card from Gertrude Stein, the expatriate American writer who was then more noted as an art collector of the cutting-edge style of the day. She was one of Picasso's loyal supporters.Floating off a sheet of music in the painting are the words, ""Ma Jolie,"" Picasso's affectionate nickname for his then-illicit lover, Eva Gouel. It's a semi-hidden, or at least sly allusion to a secret lover. Eva was to die from tuberculosis in 1916, four years after this now celebrated, clandestine cubist kiss on canvas.""I think he painted Stein's card there as a way of enticing her back as a patron,"" FitzGerald says.""Stein hadn't bought any works from Picasso in a year or two, and that was a great difficulty for him because he really depended on independent patrons like her to keep him going and to help him pay the bills.""Stein had come to see him one day at the studio, but he wasn't in. So she left her calling card. Later, he painted her card into the picture.""It was a clear ploy for attention and patronage. It worked. How could Stein refuse to buy it? So she did. Eventually, it went to the Museum of Modern Art when her collection was dispersed after her death,"" FitzGerald says.Man Of SuperstitionDespite his eventual god-like aura in the art world, Picasso was childishly superstitious. And for all his above-it-all, Olympian status as a superstar, he not only avidly collected press clippings about himself but evidently also read them.""He subscribed to a clipping service for most of his adult life,"" FitzGerald says. ""It's a quite wonderful collection for researchers because the articles are all preserved together. They're from all over the world, particularly in the 1950s and '60s, but even back into the '20s.""Picasso loved a variety of hokum and believed in magic. His friend, the poet and art critic Max Jacob, who practiced fortunetelling and was knowledgeable about astrology, probably introduced him to palmistry and the Tarot.""I think that he felt there was something supernatural about the creative spirit that he had somehow inherited,"" FitzGerald says.""If you questioned it too much, he felt, it could be destroyed, lost forever.""So he never threw away any of his clothes because, by throwing out an old coat, some of his essence might be lost,"" he says.That fear, FitzGerald suggests, made Picasso work every day to make sure that the force was always with him. ""Painting,"" Picasso once said, ""is stronger-willed than I; she makes me do what she wants.""Wide Range Of StylesThe sweeping stylistic range of the Atheneum show almost gives credence to this cosmic explanation of Picasso as a mysteriously driven force field perpetually evolving, always striving to transcend categories as he mixed classical with avant-garde elements.Even with its total focus on the studio theme, the exhibition covers an exhilarating array of styles, including realist, cubist, symbolist, surrealist, abstract and classical. The pictures span Picasso's career, from penniless, bohemian youth to old age, when he's as rich as Croesus and has invented the modern role of the artist as super celebrity.The exhibition's works range from ""La Vie,"" one of the greatest and most famous works from Picasso's Blue Period, to a suite of preliminary drawings for ""Guernica,"" his searing anti-war, anti- fascist painting of 1937.Picasso completed the symbol-laden ""La Vie"" in 1903, two years after the tragic suicide of his good friend and onetime studio-mate, the Catalan painter Carles Casagemas, who shot himself to death in a crowded Paris cafe. Carles was only 20, the same age as his beloved Pablo.Casagemas, who may have been impotent, had become despondent over his botched, lovesick attempt at an affair with a beautiful but scornful model named Germaine. He shows up as the forlorn-looking lover in ""La Vie,"" an allegory of sacred and profane love. Sexually disabled, young Casagemas is portrayed in the full monty but for his virginal, white loincloth, a symbol of his sexual inadequacy.Novelist Norman Mailer, in his sometimes unhinged but always entertaining ""interpretive biography"" of Picasso (""Portrait of Picasso As a Young Man,"" Atlantic Monthly Press, 1995), speculates that the pistol-loving Casagemas and Picasso may even have been gay lovers, or have ""merely played at the edges"" of homosexuality.""It was thinking about Casagemas,"" Picasso once confided to a friend, ""that got me started painting in blue.""""Casagemas's suicide obviously provided Picasso with a catalyst for speculating on questions of life, death, and the artist's fate in the modern world,"" William H. Robinson, an associate curator of painting at the Cleveland Museum, writes in his catalog essay unearthing layers of meaning in ""La Vie.""As heartsick, or ""blue,"" as Picasso may have been over his bosom buddy's tragic fate, his grief wasn't so inconsolable that it prevented him from crawling under the sheets with Germaine.`Guernica' And Its KinIn a radically different political and social vein, ""Guernica"" was Picasso's searing protest against the Nazis' brutal aerial bombardment of a small Basque village in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.A foreshadowing of the horrific destruction from the air in World War II, the Nazi bombers killed more than 1,600 civilians and left thousands wounded and homeless. Picasso's painting of the martyrdom of Guernica became one of if not the most universally recognized images of the 20th century.One of the preliminary drawings in the exhibition, ""The Studio: Painter and His Model,"" has jarring images evoking some of the horror and sheer visceral power of ""Guernica.""The exhibition also features a mini-herd of images of Picasso's ominous bulls and Minotaurs (half-man, half-bull creatures), along with two striking self-portraits.Among these latter images of the artist as a young man are ""Self Portrait with Palette"" (1906, oil on canvas). This painting appeared in the Atheneum's celebrated 1934 Picasso show, the first exhibition of his work held in an American museum.In this famous self-portrait, Picasso's face mirrors the mask- like Iberian image he created for his famous ""Portrait of Gertrude Stein"" in 1906. This eerie appropriation of Stein's face as a stand- in for his own, FitzGerald writes in the catalog, ""celebrated Picasso's achievement and implied an equivalence between this wealthy and established patron and the recently arrived painter.""There are classic examples of Picasso's painted challenges of El Greco and one of his many variations on the royal Spanish painter Velazquez's famous view of his studio in ""Las Meninas."" Both the cubist version of the El Greco and Velazquez paintings are part of Picasso's intensive dialogue with tradition and of his arm wrestling contests with past masters to see who's best.A macho competitor, the short, squat, powerful Spaniard in his later years loved to go into his studio and go mano a mano with the greatest heavyweight painters of all time. Laboring late into the night -- his favorite time for painting after a long day of social and business activities -- he would strive to outpaint everyone from Old Masters like Velazquez to his prime contemporary rival and sometime friend, Matisse.An AllegoryThe exhibition's grand finale, ""Painter and Infant"" -- painted when Picasso was 90 -- is an allegory of the artist in old age, even within sight of death. The infant, a symbol of youth and spontaneity, clutches a paintbrush, apparently in tandem with the aged artist.It seems to be a celebration of the power of rejuvenation and the glory of continuity, a symbolic passing of the baton from one generation to the next. It seems upbeat, flickering with hope even in the face of the old artist's impending extinction.Or so it seems at first glance.But a closer look shows that the stem of the paintbrush has snapped, and the youth now has total control.""Maybe what has happened here is that the baby has snatched the paintbrush away, and the old man is left in the dust,"" FitzGerald suggests.""Maybe the old artist, a stand-in for Picasso, didn't want to give it up. Is it a statement of optimism, pessimism, or both?""That's the kind of game Picasso loved to play,"" FitzGerald says. ""It's complex, ambivalent. It's what he saw as reality.""Sponsored by Fleet Bank in its Hartford run, ""Picasso: The Artist's Studio"" will be on exhibit through Sept. 23 at the Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main St. Admission is by timed ticket.

In the past few years both John Cunningham and Shaun Hannigan, in their different capacities, have worked hard to ensure that, no matter how different it is up there in Donegal, as the tourism slogan has it, residents of the county should be able to see world-class art on their doorsteps. Hence the appearance of the likes of Jeff Koons on the list of artists included in the county art collection.Not that the Earagail Arts Festival visual-arts programme is about bringing high art to the masses in some missionary sense. Rather the issue is one of engagement. Time and again festival events gave the sense that visual culture was something living, something rooted in the world rather than an embellishment to it, something open to debate and up for grabs.The extraordinary range of sculpture on view in Letterkenny is augmented by an excellent show of graphic work, and some small sculptures, by Henry Moore at the Glebe Gallery, in Churchill. Partly because Moore is seen as representative of the high-art tradition of modernism, his work is currently unfashionable. In particular, there is a view that his prominent publicly sited sculptures typify the practice of imposing art on the community. So there is a degree of challenge in situating his work at the heart of a regional arts festival. This is underlined by the citing of Clive Bell's celebrated phrase ""significant form"", encapsulating his emphasis on the formal elements of a work of art, in relation to Form.In that show Anish Kapoor's enigmatic and compelling objects, their surfaces thickly coated with powdered pigment, could be seen as contemporary counterparts to Moore's forms, with their rhythmic play of masses and voids. Void is the operative word in relation to Kapoor. His textured forms draw you in, trapping your gaze but leaving you curiously adrift as you lose sight of anything to hold on to. He does, as he says, make not so much objects as holes in space. He aims to offer the viewer a transcendent aesthetic experience.All of which could be seen as occupying one end of a spectrum of cultural possibility. If that is so, at the other are events with their feet firmly planted in the community. There is the festival's visual-artist-in-residence, Gerard Mannix Flynn, whose work provocatively addresses the issues that go to the heart of society, chronicling the experience of an individual thrown on the mercy of the State's institutions. And there was Dreamtime/Aisling by An Cosan Glas Cois Fharraige, which has developed an annual outdoor participatory sculpture project, involving artists and children, over the past few years.Aisling, this year's project, differed in that it culminated in a specific performance event, an hour-long beach spectacle at Tr Machaire Rabhartaigh. The organisers weren't sure what to expect in terms of audience interest, but chances were they did not expect the thousands of spectators - and the attendant traffic jam - that the event attracted. This huge response was a startling confirmation that there is an appetite for ambitious cultural projects with significant community involvement.In fact Aisling, with its 20 performers, winged willow-and-paper figures, articulated sculptures and environmental son et lumire, drew on the skills and labour of 70 children, not to mention the adults, including Seamus Kennedy, Deirdre N Bhraonain, Annjo Carr, Ewan Berry, Billy Wynter and more. It is worth pointing out, though, that technology and pyrotechnics were never in danger of eclipsing the essence of the thing as a sculptural project that drew its materials and inspiration from the elements and the environment in a profound way.Flynn's residency allowed him to assemble several of his series of recent, highly successful projects and work with them in a new context. His presence was crucial to this process, and both the text- based installations and his performative interventions elicited extraordinary responses from the audience. In complementary ways, Victim Impact Report and Not To Be Read in Open Court chronicle the experiences of an individual, James, who, put into the care of the State, is subject to institutional abuse. The works chart the levels of damage inflicted and the network of mutual reinforcement that operated between various authorities.Flynn's breakthrough in terms of articulating this issue in visual form came with his employment of the documents and language of the powerful, of the institutions themselves, so that we get a dual account, from the points of view of the subject and the powers- that-be charged with his care, that is cumulatively chilling. It is also exceptionally accessible, and the siting of Victim Impact Report in the bandstand in Market Square in Letterkenny made it even more so. It helped, of course, that Flynn's commitment was total.In another sense, so is the commitment of another festival visitor, Billy Childish, who was there in several capacities, primarily musical, perhaps, but backed up with poetry and, at the county museum, paintings. An unmistakable presence around town, Childish (known partly as a former partner of Tracey Emin) cut an anachronistic figure, tall and skinny with a prominent moustache and attired in first World War garb.All of his work is characterised by a quality of outpouring, by a seeming need to constantly express his personality. He is extraordinarily prolific in everything he does. His paintings have a rough, expressionist character with a leaning towards icons of extremity, evoking feelings of isolation, suffering and pessimism.Rather more understated by comparison, Element by Claire McLaughlin, at An Grianan Theatre, is a subtle show of small but outstanding ceramic work. Sidestepping the predictable, McLaughlin allies ceramic to the techniques of paintings and printmaking, and apparently involves the impress of natural materials, to make beautifully judged, delicately textural panels that pursue a dialogue concerning nature and culture. It is very fine, understated work that needs to be seen at first hand.Was there, in Earagail, a dialectical tension between the modernist aesthetic embodied in pieces by Picasso, Barbara Hepworth, Sir Anthony Caro and Henry Moore and the art engage of Mannix Flynn or Aisling? In the end, not really. It is not a case of arguing that community is good and art establishment bad, for example. Surely it is difficult to look at a wonderful sculpture such as Hepworth's Curved Form - Trevalgan without relating it to forms in the environment beyond the urban sprawl of Letterkenny.For all the ""development"", Co Donegal remains a place in which the influence of the sea, the landscape and the weather is pervasive and enriching. Certainly, Hepworth, Moore and a sculptor such as David Nash, some of whose work brilliantly integrates geometric form with natural materials and processes, look thoroughly at home in the wider physical context of the county and, perhaps more importantly, help to shape the way we might see it.- Exhibitions continue at the Glebe Gallery until August 27th and Letterkenny Arts Centre and Donegal County Museum until August 28thWord count: 1237Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Based on the provided news article content, I would classify the impact on Pablo Picasso's reputation, visibility, and market confidence as:

Classification: High

The article mentions Picasso's name in association with other celebrated 20th-century artists, indicating that his work is being recognized and appreciated within the art world. The mention of his work being brought to Donegal suggests increased visibility among a wider audience, including collectors, galleries, and the general public. Additionally, the absence of any negative elements in the article suggests that there is strong potential for market confidence in Picasso's work as a sound investment.",

He lived among wives, casual lovers, favourite muses and long-term mistresses. His many passionate relationships made for a turbulent life, both for himself and for his women. So turbulent, in fact, that two of the women committed suicide, and another two suffered mental breakdowns.His 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon depicts none of Picasso's lovers; the five naked women were all prostitutes. The picture was originally titled The Brothel of Avignon and included two men, clients of the young ladies. Picasso painted over the male figures, and had the five women gaze boldly, even menacingly, at the viewer. The figures on the left were inspired by prehistoric art, and the two on the right by African carved wooden masks.Breaking with the traditions of European painting, Picasso abandoned perspective in favour of a splintered, direct picture plane. That, and its raw, slashing paint-strokes made the picture not merely controversial, but downright inflammatory.Demoiselles also marked the first signs of cubism, the fragmented style Picasso invented alongside Georges Braque. It is clearly seen in the hundreds of sketches Picasso created to prepare for the picture. Now regarded as the seminal painting of the 20th century, for many it marks the dawn of modern art. The painting wasn't exhibited until 1916, when it received a ferocious response from art critics.Afterward, it remained rolled up in Picasso's studio until 1924, when his artist friends finally persuaded a somewhat reluctant collector to buy it.Picasso created at least 50,000 pieces of art in his lifetime, which, understandably may have required a fierce degree of commitment (as the critic Charles McGrath stated: ""The cruel thing about art - of great art anyway - is that it requires its practitioners to be wrapped up in themselves in a way that's a little inhuman""). But among those pieces are more acknowledged masterpieces than any other artist in history has even come close to achieving. So, though many consider Picasso a bullying misogynist, he is also revered as one of the most significant artists to have ever lived.Pablo Picasso was a child prodigy. By the age of 15, he had created the extraordinary painting Science and Charity (1897), in the realist style. After that, though, his work would take a radical turn, leaving traditional painting behind.Picasso was both loved and reviled by women. Like a Spanish bull in a corrida, he attracted female matadors to enter the spectacle in an attempt to tame the wild beast. Time and again women would be broken by Picasso's infidelity.He spent the years between 1904 and 1912 with his first love, Fernande Olivier, an artist's model and aspiring painter. She met Picasso under storm-threatening skies and as she rushed to find shelter, he stood in front of her and held out a kitten. Picasso and Olivier began living together and experimented with smoking opium. They were frequently unfaithful. Occasionally Olivier's infidelity made Picasso so overwrought with jealousy that he would lock her in his studio when he left. Years later, Picasso confessed that one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon was based on her.In 1918 he married the Russian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova, but by 1927 Picasso was having a secret affair with Marie-Therese Walter. In 1935, Walter gave birth to their daughter, Maya, but by this time Picasso's affections had already drifted towards Dora Maar. Picasso first spotted her in the Cafe Les Deux Magots in Paris, frenetically stabbing a knife between her fingers as fast as possible, until blood dotted her gloved hands. Picasso requested to keep her bloodstained gloves as a souvenir of their first encounter.""For me,"" Picasso said, ""she's the weeping woman. For years I've painted her in tortured forms, not through sadism and not with pleasure, either; just obeying a vision that forced itself on me. It was the deep reality, not the superficial one.""Following her relationship with Picasso, Maar underwent treatment in a psychiatric hospital.After a nervous breakdown, she sank into depression and lived in isolation for many years.In 1943, Picasso told his then lover Francoise Gilot: ""Women are machines for suffering."" In the early days of their nine-year affair, the artist, who was 61 at the time, warned the 21-year-old Gilot: ""For me there are only two kinds of women, goddesses and doormats.""At first, she refused to succumb to Picasso's game of cat and mouse, making no pretence of resisting his advances. Picasso was taken aback. ""How do you expect me to seduce anyone under conditions like that? If you're not going to resist - well, then, it's out of the question. I'll have to think it over."" He quickly succumbed to her charms, though, and she became his mistress.Even so, due to his uncontrollable infidelity, Gilot eventually left Picasso and went on to publish her book Life With Picasso, which sold over a million copies. The publication of Gilot's memoirs enraged Picasso and he quickly severed all ties with her. He also revoked their children's inheritance.Picasso lived out his final days with Jacqueline Roque. They met when she was 27 and he was 70. Picasso pursued Roque by bringing her a single red rose every day, composing love poems for her, and by drawing a giant dove in white chalk on the wall of her house. She became his second wife in 1961, and during the last 17 years of his life, she was the only woman he painted. When Picasso was buried, Roque lay over his grave and slept there all night in the snow. She, like Walter, eventually committed suicide.Although these tempestuous relationships shared by Picasso and his many women were at times disturbing, the experiences they shared are inextricably linked to the masterpieces he created.As he said, ""one must act in painting as in life, directly."" His last words, at 91, were: ""Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can't drink any more.""(c) Charles Saatchi 2018Time and again women would be broken by Picasso's infidelityCredit: Comment telegraph.co.uk/opinion Charles Saatchi's Great masterpiecesIllustrationCaption: Fragmentary genius: Picasso made hundreds of sketches to prepare for his painting; SUCCESSION PICASSO/DACS LONDON 2018Word count: 1032Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Most use social media like Facebook and other virtual platforms to market their products.Rithika Kumar, painter and founder of Pyjama Party, an outfit selling exclusive and customised hand-painted home d√©cor, is one such example. ""Pyjama Party started as self expression"" says Kumar, ""it is something I enjoy and love doing and am emotionally invested in."" But is being emotionally attached to something you love enough? ""The key is to keep at it and experiment,"" she suggests. Practice only improves your chances of getting better. ""Every time you're done with an order you should feel like its a little part of you. Give every piece your very best and the money will flow in automatically,"" she advises.Being self employed can be rewarding, but it's not all fun and games. ""Bringing discipline into my daily routine is the biggest challenge; it calls for focus and being able to prioritise,"" she warns.¬† You are what you are passionate about and that's what makes you unique. ""To be extraordinary one must be able to express it from within and with passion.""Passion is what drives nail artist Sakshi Kastiya, founder, Sakshi Kastiya's Nail Art. She says, ""Every client I meet is different and I aim at depicting/expressing it through their nails."" She began her journey in class VIII when she found a DIY book on nail art and started painting her own nails and that of her friends and relatives as a hobby.¬† The hobby soon grew into an addiction. ""It grew to something bigger in my life, my passion. It was a stress buster, a mood lifter,"" she says adding that nail art taught her how to read each individual's unique personality and express it through paint.Art is happiness, it colours one's life and soul. ""When you know that you've made a woman more confident by painting her nails it inspires you. The smile that you see on your client's face when she can't stop adoring her nails is priceless,"" Kastiya exclaims. One however, needs to keep up to date with the various designs and new methods. ""If you fail to do so, people may turn to other things and you're bound to die in this industry,"" she warns. For Stefan Fernandes, founder, Shoe-U, a brand that offers hand painted designs on old and new shoes, coming up with new ideas is the biggest test. ""When you do something you love, the element of boredom will never arise,"" he quips.Fernandes was blown away the moment he saw the work done by one of the artist at a shoe painting workshop conducted at a college fest in Goa. ""I never had any training as such but I wanted to do something unique and creative, so I started with simple designs for myself and a few friends,"" he says. Soon this part time passion turned into a possible career when he created Shoe-U.""First, I thought of a catchy name and a tag line then I made my page of Facebook and soon orders started to flow in."" he says. However, the reward of following one's passion takes time. ""It's never too certain, the pay solely depends on the orders,"" says Fernandes. Tattoo artist Al Alva, founder, Als Tattoo Studio, which offers tattoo body art, believes that pay prospects in any career depends upon the clients and also on one's own experience. ""People prefer going to artists that are more experienced as it is a safer bet and training adds to it,"" he says. However, when it comes to passion, money is not a worry. ""If you are content you will do a good job which will lead you to becoming a brand that the world is ready to pay any amount for,"" observes Alva. Alva's romance with tattooing started when he was a kid. He used to watch artist inking into other people's skin and ""that's when I got the idea and tried experimenting with a guitar string on my brother,"" he laughs. His mother however, didn't approve of it as she believed that people who have a lot of money and prefer not working become tattoo artists. Jamming needles into other people's skins is not a joke. ""I realised that I needed some kind of training as I didn't want to damage anyone's skin or tissues. So I headed to Amsterdam for professional training,"" he recalls.¬†¬†Inking someone is not like paint, it cannot be washed away. There's no erasing or using a new page. ""A tattoo artist needs to have a steady hand to get the design right and it is a big commitment, so it's always better to give your own inputs and suggestions so you're comfortable with it,"" suggests Alva.¬† """"Credit:Patricia MascarenhasWord count: 903Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

TOURING PICASSO'S EL GUERNICA [ET Panache]: King Felipe of Spain recently gifted former US President Barack Obama a book detailing Pablo Picasso's most famous painting El Guernica. Let's take a closer look at this famous masterpiece's journey,The Economic Times (Online),23 July 2018,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitready reckoner1 Recognised as Picasso's most powerful political statement, the 'El Guernica' is a mural-size oil painting created in response to the Nazi bombing of Guernica (a little Spanish village) during the Spanish Civil War. The painting features tormented and distorted figures -- like a gored horse, a bull and flames -- done in a palette of grey, black and white to depict the horrors of mechanised war.2 Commissioned by the Spanish Republican government for the 1937 Paris International Exposition, the oil-on-canvas piece was initially supposed to be a large mural on Picasso's perennial theme of the artist's studio. However, after the devastating bombing, Picasso abandoned his initial idea and started sketching preliminary drawings for Guernica which would soon became a powerful anti-war symbol.3 Between exhibitions in Europe and the Americas, Guernica was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City on Picasso's request. Picasso believed that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until democracy had been established in the country.4 Spain finally became a democratic constitutional monarchy in 1978 but the MoMA was reluctant to release the painting, claiming that a monarchy did not satisfy Picasso's condition of delivery. Bowing to international pressure, the painting was finally released to the Museo del Prado, Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth.5 As a cautionary measure against attacks, when 'El Guernica' finally arrived in Spain, it was displayed behind bomb-and-bullet proof glass screens before being moved to the Queen Sof√≠a National Art Centre Museum where it resides currently.6 As an additional precautionary measure, the museum roped in Spanish telecommunication company Telefonica to develop a 250,000 pound machine to check the painting's health ahead of its 75th anniversary.7 Unlike Picasso's other works, the Guernica has never been up for sale and has no listed price attached. However, some valuations have placed the painting around $200mn.Word count: 319Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

A scarlet rug with a strange black splodge pattern lies on a floor covered with terracotta hexagonal tiles.The red and yellow-striped Catalan flag acts as the headboard to a double bed that faces ceiling-to-waist windows through which light floods in.Outside, towering above, is the rocky summit of Mont Sainte-Victoire - the much-loved subject of local artist Paul Cezanne, who painted more than 80 versions of it. I am standing in the minimalist, one-time bedroom of Pablo Picasso.In 1958, Picasso rang his art dealer Kahnweiler to tell him he'd bought Cezanne's Mont Sainte-Victoire.""Which one?"" asked the latter.""The real one,"" replied the artist.What he'd actually bought was the Chateau de Vauvenargues, an austere 17th-century house on the edge of the small village of the same name, and 2,500 acres of land at the foot of this celebrated mountain.Desiring to escape the attention he received at his home in Cannes, Picasso lived here with his wife Jacqueline and her daughter Catherine from 1959 to 1961.Now, to coincide with a new exhibition that aims to show how Picasso was heavily influenced by the man he referred to as ""Monsieur Cezanne, the father of us all"", the chateau, still owned by Catherine, is opening its doors to the public for the first time until September 27.Earlier, I'd left my comfortable room in the traditional surroundings of Hotel Cardinal in the centre of Aix-en-Provence, a university town and the capital of Provence from the 12th to the 18th century, and made my way past the 17th-century mansions in the Mazarin Quarter, to the Granet Museum - a former priory of the Knights of Malta and the home of the Picasso-Cezanne exhibition.The exhibition has four themes: Picasso observes Cezanne, Picasso collects Cezanne, Shared themes and shapes and Picasso gets closer to Cezanne, all of which aim to explore for the first time the Frenchman's influence on the Spaniard.Looking at the artists' works, many of which are from private collections and have never been exhibited before, it appears there was indeed a strong connection between the two men (who never met).It comes as no surprise that Picasso moved to this inspirational part of France - sweeping landscapes, great light and a relaxed way of life.I headed down cafe-lined Cours Mirabeau in the shade of the plane trees, past Cafe Deux Garcons, well-known for attracting the great writers and artists of the day, and Bechard, lauded for its delicious calissons - elipse-shaped sweets made from ground almonds and melon.Embedded in the pavement I noticed a dirty gold stud with a capital C in the middle, indicating I was literally following in Cezanne's footsteps - the studs form a trail around town taking in the major sites associated with the artist, including his light-filled studio.A leaflet to the self-guided tour is available from the tourist office near the Rotunda fountain, the most impressive of Aix's 40 fountains, where dolphins spout water over the heads of lions. It's here too that you catch the bus to Vauvenargues. Back in the present, I feel uncomfortable, as though I've been shown around someone's home while they're away - paints and brushes are still stacked in the studio/drawing room, favourite objects, a home movie of the family in happy times.But they haven't gone away. In front of the house's entrance is a circular piece of lawn with a primitive sculpture atop, Woman with Vase, and it is here that Picasso and Jacqueline are buried.In death, as in life, the couple found the solitude that they so craved - but for how long?Fact fileGetting There: By train -take Eurostar to Lille or Paris, then the TGV to Aix-en-Provence.

We wear them and use them to decorate our homes. Yet rarely are they considered treasured possessions to be kept or collected. Instead, as fashions change, we buy new clothes and replace our curtains. And in most cases we never know or ask who designed the fabrics from which they are made. But in the optimistic postwar years, they were all the rage. Some of the biggest names in the art world - Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Cocteau, Eduardo Paolozzi, Henry Moore among them - designed textiles and, fortunately, a few of these have survived. This month sees a celebration of these ""lost"" masterpieces with the publication of a new book and a dazzling selling exhibition, which opens at The Fine Art Society in London on Monday.Artist-designed textiles were a postwar art form, which set out to make art democratic and accessible to the population at large. Modern Britain was to be a brighter and more equal society, and artists as much as any group were determined to make sure this happened. Between the wars, artists had already sought to break down the status distinctions that existed between fine art and industrially produced objects. For these modern thinkers, painting, sculpture and the applied arts, including book illustration, graphic and textile design, were all important. Artists would move seamlessly from one to another. Edward Bawden and John Piper are two such creative British polymaths whose textiles are included in the show.For the British textile industry, which was much in need of a boost after wartime restrictions, involving artists seemed like a good way to improve pattern design and also to raise the industry's profile and sales at home and abroad. There were already isolated examples to look to, in particular the successful 20-year collaboration of the painter Raoul Dufy with French manufacturers, which had produced many powerful and original fabrics.In Britain Ascher's series of ""artist squares"" headscarves, introduced in 1946 by the Czech emigres Zika and Lida Ascher, injected a new and influential design direction to the industry. With the headscarf the fashion accessory of the moment, it was the ideal textile choice, particularly with materials, inks and dyes all still in limited supply. In commissioning leading British and French modern artists, and placing no restrictions on them beyond the size of the square, Ascher demonstrated what artists could achieve. Displayed in 1947 stretched on easels at the Lefevre Gallery in London, many buyers of the squares seem even then to have preferred framing to wearing them. As Annamarie Stapleton, co-curator of the Fine Art Society exhibition, says: ""People who buy artists' textiles today generally want to display them as decoration, rather than to use them for their original purpose as clothing or upholstery.""It took some years for a more painterly aesthetic to emerge widely in British textiles. Of great importance was the 1953 exhibition Paintings into Textiles organised by the British trade export magazine, The Ambassador, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. Twenty-five artists were commissioned to produce artworks that might inspire new designs and many were purchased for that purpose by leading manufacturers who attended.

Compare Moore's abstract horizontal design with Cawthra Mulock's figurative, wax-drawn images. With Whitehead's emphasis on good design, value and serviceability, the company succeeded far more than Ascher in making artists' textiles accessible to the masses.Two other British firms were central to this movement, Horrockses Fashions of Preston and Edinburgh Weavers. Eduardo Paolozzi's canvas was almost exactly translated by Horrockses into a stunning yellow, black and white cotton and made up into an eye-catching sun dress. Converting paintings to woven fabrics was a far more demanding and expensive business. But as the exhibition shows, Edinburgh Weavers succeeded spectacularly in reproducing the textures and raised surfaces to be seen in artists' original work while also printing others on cotton.The scale of many of the patterns is quite unexpected. These textiles seem to be huge colourful canvases, which would dominate many rooms. Some were commissioned for specific public buildings, which needed big bright curtains. But large patterns were also produced for domestic spaces. ""Artists' textiles made people look again at how textiles could be used in the home.

I am standing in the minimalist, one-time bedroom of Pablo Picasso.In 1958, Picasso rang his art dealer Kahnweiler to tell him that he'd bought Cezanne's Mont Ste-Victoire.""Which one?"" asked the latter.""The real one,"" replied the artist.What he'd actually bought was the Chateau de Vauvenargues, an austere 17th-century house on the edge of the small village of the same name, and 2,500 acres of land at the foot of this celebrated mountain.Desiring to escape the attention he received at his home in Cannes, Picasso lived here with his wife Jacqueline and her daughter Catherine from 1959 to 1961.Now, to coincide with a new exhibition that aims to show how Picasso was heavily influenced by the man he referred to as ""Monsieur Cezanne, the father of us all"", the chateau, still owned by Catherine, is opening its doors to the public for the first time until September 27.Earlier, I'd left my comfortable room in the traditional surroundings of Hotel Cardinal in the centre of Aix-en-Provence, a university town and the capital of Provence from 12th to 18th century, and made my way past the 17th-century mansions in the Mazarin Quarter, to the Granet Museum - a former priory of the Knights of Malta and the home of the Picasso-Cezanne exhibition.The exhibition has four themes: Picasso observes Cezanne, Picasso collects Cezanne, Shared themes and shapes and Picasso gets closer to Cezanne, all of which aim to explore for the first time the Frenchman's influence on the Spaniard.Looking at the artists' works, many of which are from private collections and have never been exhibited before, it appears there was indeed a strong connection between the two men (who never met).It comes as no surprise that Picasso moved to this inspirational part of France - sweeping landscapes, great light and a relaxed way of life.I headed down cafe-lined Cours Mirabeau in the shade of the plane trees, past Cafe Deux Garcons, well-known for attracting the great writers and artists of the day, and Bechard, lauded for its delicious calissons - elipse-shaped sweets made from ground almonds and melon.Embedded in the pavement I noticed a dirty-gold stud with a capital C in the middle, indicating I was literally following in Cezanne's footsteps - the studs form a trail around town taking in the major sites associated with the artist including his light-filled studio.A leaflet to the self-guided tour is available from the tourist office near the Rotunda fountain, the most impressive of Aix's 40 fountains, where dolphins spout water over the heads of lions. It's here too that you catch the bus to Vauvenargues.Back in the present, I feel uncomfortable, as though I've been shown around someone's home while they're away - paints and brushes are still stacked in the studio/drawing room, favourite objects, a home-movie of the family in happy times.But they haven't gone away. In front of the house's entrance is a circular piece of lawn with a primitive sculpture atop, Woman with Vase, and it is here that Picasso and Jacqueline are buried. In death, as in life, they found the solitude they craved - but for how long?Factfile Getting There: By train - take Eurostar to Lille or Paris then the TGV to Aix-en-Provence.

He doesn't know what he wants. No wonder his style is so ambiguous. It's like God's. God is really only another artist. He invented the giraffe, the elephant and the cat. He has no real style. He just keeps on trying other things. The same with this sculptor. First he works from nature; then he tries abstraction. Finally he winds up lying around caressing his models.""The comparison to God, like the use of the third person, was deliberate, of course. As John Richardson reminds us in the third volume of his magisterial and definitive biography, Picasso not only worshipped the gods Dionysius, Priapus and Mithra (the god of light and wisdom), but also regarded himself as their confrere - an artist so prodigally talented, so daring and so virtuosic that he could reinvent the universe. He was a Nietzschean shaman who regarded art as a mysterious, magical force, offering the possibility of exorcism and transfiguration; a chameleon who effortlessly moved between Cubism and classicism, irony and sentimentality, cruelty and tenderness; a wily, self-mythologizing sorcerer who inhaled history, ideas and a wealth of styles with promiscuous abandon - all toward the end of exploding conventional ways of looking at the world and remaking that world anew.In A Life of Picasso: The Triumphant Years, Richardson takes up the story of the Minotaur of Modernism where he left off, a decade ago, in Vol. 2, with Picasso's growing interest in classicism. This volume lacks the great drama of the preceding volume, which chronicled the crucial development of Cubism - a movement, in Richardson's view, that would nourish all of the artist's later achievements and propel ""every major modernist movement"" of succeeding decades.This book, in contrast, deals with Picasso's mid-career forays into a variety of styles - from his reworking of the masters to his growing interest in sculpture to his experiments with the radical deconstruction of the human body. Richardson sketches out the competitive dialogue that Picasso carried on for years with Matisse, charts his transit from bohemia to the bourgeoisie, and maps the myriad intramural spats and schisms that fractured the avant-garde, all the while conjuring the heady, incestuous world of artists (including Ernest Hemingway and Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, none of whom Picasso much liked), patrons and socialites that Picasso frequented in 1920s France.Although this all makes for a more discursive and at times less focused narrative than that of Vol. 2, The Triumphant Years, like its predecessors, is informed by Richardson's consummate knowledge of Picasso's work - his intimate understanding of the artist's temperament and endlessly inventive styles, his expansive vocabulary of myths and motifs and, most important, the mysterious nature of the alchemy by which he transformed his own experiences and emotions into art. The reader's one serious complaint is that photos of individual works are not always included or do not appear on the same page on which they are so artfully deconstructed. Richardson leaves us with a deep appreciation of Picasso's Promethean ambition and prodigious fecundity, and a shrewd understanding of his tumultuous, subversive and often disturbing art.Richardson's Picasso is not the destructive, misanthropic egomaniac portrayed in the Merchant-Ivory film Surviving Picasso or the heroic hipster artist of Norman Mailer's Portrait of Picasso as a Young Man. His Picasso is a mass of contradictions, a savage artist, who was often horribly cruel to friends like Jean Cocteau but who also ""had a very loyal, if sometimes paradoxical heart""; a deeply superstitious trickster, who loved paradox in both his work and life, playing ""volumetric representationalism off synthetic Cubist flatness, much as he enjoyed playing Olga's conventionality against his own instinctive iconoclasm.""Picasso once observed that his work was a kind of diary of his life, and in this continuing biography (there is one more volume to come) Richardson expertly explicates that diary, showing us how the artist encoded his day-to-day relationships with women in his work; how his homes, his surroundings and his cannibalistic study of other painters' work informed individual canvases and sketches.Richardson notes that during the first five years of Picasso's marriage to the snobbish Russian dancer Olga, she ""appears only in representational portraits, from which the affection gradually seeps, never in any of his innovative masterpieces."" Only later, as her ill health and psychological difficulties took a toll on their marriage, would Olga ""play a dominant role in Picasso's revolutionary imagery."" These issues, Richardson writes, would result in ""images seething with ridicule and rage, cruelty, and resentment"" - with Olga depicted, say, with a dagger-sharp tongue or a bifurcated head, ""goggle-eyed and manic on the left, depressed and tranquilized on the right.""In contrast, Richardson says, Picasso's young mistress, Marie- Therese, helped him ""unleash his sexuality and harness it to his imagery."" Intent on keeping their relationship a secret, he disguised her presence in key paintings like Artist and His Model, ""secure in the knowledge that only he and possibly Marie-Therese"" knew ""what the painting is really about.""Shadowy Peter Pan-collar shapes, a stringed instrument (often signified by ""the ideogram of a guitar hanging on a wall""), a flying dove symbolizing freedom, a bionic gas pump with hose-like arms - these were just some of the images, Richardson contends, that Picasso used to conjure Marie-Therese.In fact, the idea of transformation was central to Picasso's art: he turned people into objects, and objects into stylized symbols. Women were carved up and reassembled, landscapes were turned into humanoid forms, noses and mouths were transformed into phalluses and vaginas. As Richardson tells it, the Roman poet Ovid, whose Metamorphoses recounted tales of change and transformation as a metaphor for the chaotic nature of the world, ""had begun to exert a far more radical influence on Picasso's choice of theme and imagery than any contemporary poet.""Violent change and transmogrification became means by which Picasso could use his voracious visual memory and digestive powers to assimilate the work of other artists, and by reinventing their idioms and images, somehow triumph over them - to show, in his magical and warlike view of art, that he now possessed them, possessed the past, and was now steering history in a new, Modernist direction.""I am God,"" Picasso once told a Spanish friend.

"The poetic side of genius ; Pablo Picasso's writing - done in the raw, unpunctuated style of the Surrealists - receives its first major translation into English in a new volume of poetry.: [ALL Edition]",The Christian Science Monitor,18 Mar 2005,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hit Near the end of his life, Pablo Picasso predicted to a friend he would be remembered as a ""Spanish poet who dabbled in painting, drawing, and sculpture."" The most famous artist of the 20th century was certainly joking. Picasso (1881-1973) knew he would be forever identified as the figure who rejected Renaissance traditions, ushering in a complex new relationship of the artist to the visible world and the audience.The comment is meaningful, for it provides a glimpse into a lesser-known side of the protean master. From 1935, when he was 54 years old, until 1959, Picasso devoted himself to a body of writing that was boldly and consciously poetic.""I abandon sculpture, engraving and painting,"" he wrote to Spanish poet and boyhood friend Jaime Sabartes in 1936, ""to dedicate myself entirely to song."" The result was a series of notebooks, sketchbooks, journals, even napkins filled with prose poems that, like his paintings, are dense in imagery, relentlessly energetic, and frequently enigmatic.Now the poems are available in English for the first time with the publication of a comprehensive volume of Picasso's writings, ""The Burial of the Count of Orgaz & Other Poems."" Coeditors Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris collected the writings from the original Spanish and French.Picasso's literary output has been little more than a footnote to public awareness of his artistic contribution, but ""it's the work of an accomplished poet,"" says Mr. Rothenberg. ""It was not trivial work. It's part of the history of experimental poetry in the 20th century.""The painter began writing seriously at a time in his life when a divorce impelled him to take a break from painting. Rothenberg explains in the book's preface that through 1935 and 1936, Picasso largely ignored paint and canvas and immersed himself in written expression. Afterward, over more than two decades, he often returned to writing, producing three plays in addition to the 300-plus texts in ""Burial.""""He didn't feel like painting, but the creative rush was still coming through, so he wrote,'' says Mr. Joris. ""It became one of the ways he expressed that energy.""The writings are unlikely to remake Picasso's image into that of a poet, at least in the conventional sense. His poems are not deliberate constructions of meaning, but rather rippling Surrealist wordplay. They could just as well be called literary paintings. They unleash a dazzling, allusive torrent of sensory description and dreamlike action in such images as ""wings of forgotten colors,"" ""the sundrop falling on the tip of the knife,"" and ""white blue white yellow and rose white of an apple green."" Nearly all the writings were created as prose blocks, rarely in traditional verse lines, and dated rather than titled.Picasso wrote in a stream-of-consciousness style, without punctuation or capitalization, following the counsel of poet Andre Breton in his 1924 ""First Surrealist Manifesto,"" to ""write quickly with no preconceived subject."" The aim, for Breton and Picasso, was to bypass literal meaning and sweep the unconscious for unexpected riches of expression. A Picasso entry dated May 4, 1935, begins, ""All the shredded shadows peel off the bodies with haste of the start of a journey and faithful to their appointment with light....""""It's a kind of writing at top speed. The pencil does not leave the paper,"" explains Joris. Picasso, he ventures, may be ""the most accomplished Surrealist poet. In terms of going for the absolute Surrealist process of breaking all syntactical barriers and eliminating the [intellectual] policeman who prevents you from saying things.""Surrealist writings provide insight into Picasso's art, art scholar and curator Richard Kendall observes.""They are of interest,"" he explains. ""Not frivolous or foolish. A lot of people don't realize how engaged Picasso became with Surrealism, what a big part the tormented, the macabre, the dreamlike, the fantastical played in his work. His writing is of a piece with that.""Picasso provided art for Surrealist journals, and was close friends with writers and artists associated with the movement. ""The Surrealist strand is always there, but it comes through in the 1930s,"" Mr. Kendall says. He cites Picasso's great antiwar painting ""Guernica"" as ""the picture of a nightmare."" The poetry ""brings something to our understanding of 'Guernica.' ""Rothenberg and Joris, who collaborated on the book from their respective homes near San Diego, Calif., and Albany, N.Y., are best known for ""Poems of the Millennium,"" a 1,600-page, two-volume anthology of avant-garde, alternative, and postmodern poetry. It was while compiling that project that the two men, both accomplished poets in their own right, first published Picasso.The present collection was translated by Joris, Rothenberg, and more than a dozen contributing poets from a 1989 French volume, ""Picasso: Writings."" While both editors hope publication of the English version will be regarded as a literary event, they are aware that Picasso's seminal importance as a painter is the main interest.""It's more likely to be an event for artists and art historians,"" says Rothenberg. ""It's hard to break through those boundaries.""Kendall agrees. ""We're interested in almost everything Picasso did. If he had not been an extraordinary artist, his writings might then have disappeared. They're a minor aspect of his extraordinary career.""Joris, for his part, argues that the writing stands on its own merit. ""These are live poems. These are not museum pieces,"" he says. ""They may be more alive at this point, fresher - they have not been framed, like the paintings, by tons of critical discourse.""While their relative merit may be debated, the writings nevertheless give voice to Picasso's intent as an artist. Whether as pictures or words, his art aimed for the same effect. ""Everything you find in these poems,"" he insisted, ""you can also find in my paintings. So many painters have forgotten poetry ... and it's the most important thing.""26.1.37orange blossom jasmine cabinet perfumed with pine scent little sugar cube stuck sentry-like on point of bayonet drawn from his gaze and bleeding honey from his fingers on the dove's wings burning at lake bottom in the skillet of his eyes shows up exactly at the happy hour with its flower needle pin prick poised to touch the sea's snout blue bull winged incandescent spread out at the ocean's rim- Pablo Picasso2 July 38drop bydrophardlypale bluediesbetweenthe claws ofgreen almondon the rosetrellis- Pablo Picasso(c) Copyright 2005.

The man's protrusion is long, thin and flaccid. The woman's shorter and more rigid, unmistakably erect. Entitled ""The Conversation"" (2007), this morsel of demonic mischief is a perfect metaphor for Anatomies of Desire, a new show devoted to Picasso and Louise Bourgeois at the Zurich gallery of Hauser &Wirth.By the time Bourgeois painted her tongues, the Spaniard had been dead for over 30 years. Nevertheless his colossal shadow still loomed over every contemporary artist, just as it had for most of his 70-year career.Bourgeois, by contrast, found success late in life. Born in 1911 in Paris, she had her first solo show in New York in 1945 but little recognition followed. Only after a retrospective at MoMA in 1982, when she was already 71, did her name gain international heft.Such facts matter because although the Zurich show ‚Äî which brims over with tongues, breasts, vaginas and penises in the work of both artists ‚Äî seems to be about sex, it is really about power.

The man's protrusion is long, thin and flaccid. The woman's shorter and more rigid, unmistakably erect. Entitled ""The Conversation"" (2007), this morsel of demonic mischief is a perfect metaphor for Anatomies of Desire, a new show devoted to Picasso and Louise Bourgeois at the Zurich gallery of Hauser &Wirth.By the time Bourgeois painted her tongues, the Spaniard had been dead for over 30 years. Nevertheless his colossal shadow still loomed over every contemporary artist, just as it had for most of his 70-year career.Bourgeois, by contrast, found success late in life. Born in 1911 in Paris, she had her first solo show in New York in 1945 but little recognition followed. Only after a retrospective at MoMA in 1982, when she was already 71, did her name gain international heft.Such facts matter because although the Zurich show ‚Äî which brims over with tongues, breasts, vaginas and penises in the work of both artists ‚Äî seems to be about sex, it is really about power.

He was the greatest publicist, even more than Salvador Dali, but, alas, he wasn't the greatest painter.Matisse and Braque were better painters and influenced me much more than Picasso did. They related their works to the humanism of their time not like Picasso who loved art but not life.His work was a celebration decorative as the most beautiful ceramic but it was devoid of all compassion. His technique as an oil painter was atrocious as he just filled in spaces. And how he got away with it is beyond me.Picasso participated in what promised to be a major intellectual revolution but really his so-called iconoclastic work was to be the greatest bluff of all time.Since Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Picasso's love affair with African art was to wrongly influence fashionable Parisian art in the early part of the 20th Century and with Dada and Marcel Duchamp producing their iconoclastic doodles, art has suffered a tremendous clash of long existence aesthetic techniques, rules and values.And, for me, it has never fully recovered.From this wrong turn in direction largely influenced by Picasso, the dealers' paradise flourished to make the artist one of the most expensive and fashionable painters of the 20th Century.Art within this anarchy and chaos has since become the norm.The boundaries of art have been pushed further and further ever since skill and excellence have been replaced by philo-sophical linguistic musings, the expression of psychological trauma and sociological comment.The current trends seem to have replaced art with the artist, the dominance of the entrepreneur media class and museum curators with a syndrome which I shall class the Chinese Emperor's New Clothes.Art has become all absurd concept and no substance.Official museums and galleries have become deceived into confusing the Disney derivations of most of Picasso's work with great contemporary art.Picasso comes out of his artistic closet to displace.He even said of himself that his paintings were a series of ""cock- and-bull stories.""There seems little doubt that the most important of Picasso's work came in the 30 years between Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Guernica (1937).Whereas they seem to have been the favourites of most of the art critics of the 20th Century, they leave me very disappointed.Guernica is not a cry from the heart - a cry of anguish - but has as much feeling as a Parisian prose poem from a fashionable salon. And his earlier work is heavy with Spanish sentimentality and cliches, the ultimate statements of fashionable bathos.He was a superstitious, sarcastic man, very cruel to his children and his women.He had contempt for women artists. His famous remark of women being goddesses or doormats has rendered him odious to feminists, but despite this his charm was legendary.Whole cultural industries derived from his much mythologised virility. He was the Great Minotaur in a canvas and collage labyrinth of his own construction.A dealer selling Rothko not too long ago when Rothko was fairly unknown sold one of his canvases depicting a thin red line on a totally black background for pounds 45,000 and when he was asked, ""Why such a high price?"" the dealer replied, ""If I had asked the true value of pounds 45 no one would have looked at it.""The same applies to a Picasso. No painter or sculptor, not even Titian, has been as famous as Picasso in his own lifetime and it's quite possible that none will ever be so again.Picasso, the cunning Spaniard that he was, was the first artist to enjoy and exploit the obsessive attention of the new mass media of the latter part of the 20th Cen t ury.Standing at the intersection of adoration and restless changes of style, maybe his constant pushing of the envelope would not have created such controversy and such celebrity if he was painting today.His inspiration for his pictures was always derivative of other artists and other art periods but never from life. Gertrude Stein, on seeing her finished portrait is supposed to have complained, ""I don't look at all like that,"" with Picasso replying, ""You will, Gertrude, you will.""In today's art world, where the cult of personality is as seemingly important as creativity, it's hard to imagine such a giant of his time arising.His output was vast. This is not a virtue in itself as only a few paintings by Vermeer survive and only about 11 by the brothers Van Eyck, but they are as firmly lodged in history as Picasso was or ever will be.And the extraordinary thing is Picasso never painted an abstract picture in his life.If Picasso had died before 1906, his 25th year, I think that his mark on 20th Century art would have been very slight.So the question is not whether Picasso was a great artist, great personality or great innovator, but whether his personality and legacy was ""great"" enough to survive in this century.Picasso's century is dead as far as I am concerned.May it rest in peace with him.IllustrationCaption: GENIUS?

Original artworks of Picasso, Joan Mir√≥, Antoni Clav√©, Antoni T√†pies, Miquel Ibarz, Ramon Llovet, Miguel Rasero, as well as, Frenchartists Gaston-Louis Roux and Xavier will now be on display in Ahmedabad at the L&P Huthessing Visual Arts Centre gallery.""It is for the first time that artworks of this quality of European masters, who have been inspiration for many artists across the globe, will be on display in Ahmedabad, Gujarat and India,"" expresses Umang Hutheesing. Umang is organising this exhibition in collaboration with the Galeria Joan Gasper, Barcelona, Spain. Titled 'A Collection of European Art' this exhibition will have on display 40 extensive and rare artworks. It will be inaugurated on February 4 and will continue till February 6.Umang further adds that, ""This is a goodwill and friendship gesture between curator Nupur Tron, Spanish art curator Joan Gasper who has been showing works of European masters to the general public and me. In galleries across Europe, such master pieces can only be viewed at a price. And it is not everyone's privilege to go abroad and see such private collections. Hence, it is our honour to bring this to Ahmedabad, Gujarat and India for the very first time.""Giving a brief background Umang mentions that the art history of the Gaspar family started in the beginning of XX Century when it was founded the Sala Gaspar. In 1992 Joan Gaspar decided to open 'Galeria Joan Gaspar' Barcelona, Spain which has been continuing the tradition of Sala Gaspar, showing works of European masters. However, it also presents contemporary artists whose reputation has become consolidated over the years. During the last 20 years, Galeria Joan Gaspar collaborated with museums and cultural institutions in organisation of public exhibitions and one of Spain's most reputed galleries and art advisors.But Umang will not be stopping here of showcasing such rare works. He says, ""I have also been invited to showcase this exhibition to art collectors in China. In addition, I am also planning a meeting and/or collaboration with Alexandra Foley, who works with London advisors to EON productions, on a James Bond Exhibition to be held in India. Let's see how it all goes.""""Credit:after hrs correspondentWord count: 435Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Charles Bremner reports.PARIS -- Pablo Picasso was refused French nationality because the intelligence police deemed the Spanish painter to be a threat to society.The details of Picasso's unsuccessful 1940 request for citizenship emerged from an enthralling dossier, disclosed this week, covering four decades of the artist's life in Paris through the eyes of the police.The request was turned down because the police intelligence arm said ""the self-described modern painter ... has kept his extremist ideas"" despite 39 years in France.The episode raises the question of whether French citizenship, which Picasso sought because of the imminent German invasion, would have changed the artist. In the event, Picasso remained a Catalan patriot while a fixture of the art scene in France, where he spent most of his adult life and died in 1973.The Picasso files were returned in 2000 from Moscow to the Paris police headquarters after a journey that began with their seizure by the occupying Nazis and then an interlude of 55 years in the archives of the former Soviet KGB security agency.The files, written in dry policeman's language, show that the intelligence service took an interest in ""a certain Picasso, Pablo Ruiz,"" from the day that the 20-year-old painter arrived in Montmartre in 1901. He was lodged on the Boulevard de Clichy by Pierre Manach, a Catalan anarchist who was already under surveillance. ""In consequence, there is reason to consider Picasso an anarchist,"" says the report.An officer watching the obscure painter recounted his habits, passing on gossip from landlords and tradesmen, according to extracts that appeared in this week's L'Express magazine. ""The times of his comings and goings are very irregular ... He goes out every evening, coming back at an advanced hour in the night ... Sometimes he even stays out all night,"" wrote the case officer.Picasso applied for naturalization in April 1940, two months before the Nazis occupied Paris. He apparently feared internment as a national of a country allied to the Germans.Police concluded that he deserved citizenship because, among other things, ""through his professional skills, he would be a useful addition to the community."" However, police intelligence opposed the approval with a damaging report that raked up his supposed anarchist credentials.""Picasso has kept his extremist ideas while evolving towards communism,"" it said, citing an incident in May 1940 in the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. ""He attacked a Polish officer, in civilian clothes, while openly criticizing our institutions and praising the Soviets.""The report noted reports of ""drawings representing the hammer and sickle"" in his apartment and reported gossip that he sent abroad the ""millions"" that he earned in France.""As a result of all the information that has been gathered, this foreigner has no qualification for being naturalized ... he must be considered as a suspect from the state's point of view.""

With what look like knitting needles for tears, Maar's misshapen fingers attempt to damn a cascade gushing not from her eyes (which Picasso has transplanted on to the side of her forehead) but from the top of her nose. Maar, Picasso once explained, typified the ""weeping woman ... because women are suffering machines"".In truth, Bourgeois was no vulnerable herbivore and there was far more to Picasso than boorish flesh-eater. From 1971, when the Spaniard's powers were on the wane, comes the painting ""Nude Man and Woman"".

"Visitor tears Picasso's 'The Actor.' How can Met fix it?: A visitor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York lost her balance and fell into a Pablo Picasso painting, 'The Actor,' tearing the canvas. Art restorers explain how it might be repaired.",The Christian Science Monitor,25 Jan 2010,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitA visitor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York lost her balance and fell into a Pablo Picasso painting, 'The Actor,' tearing the canvas. Art restorers explain how it might be repaired. Art restorers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will soon begin repairs to a prominent Pablo Picasso painting damaged by a visitor last week in an unusual accident. A visitor attending a class at the museum last Friday lost her balance and fell into the canvas, creating a 6-inch tear in the lower right hand corner of ""The Actor,"" a more than 6-foot tall painting depicting a pink-hued acrobat.The painting was immediately taken to the Met's paintings conservation department, where masterpieces are brought for cleaning, restoration, and in rare cases, repair, the museum said in a statement. Some reports put the painting's value at $130 million. Another Picasso picture from 1905, ""Garcon a la Pipe,"" sold for $104.2 million at Sotheby's in 2004. The 1904-1905 painting from Picasso's so-called rose period is expected to be repaired in time for the museum's upcoming exhibition, ""Picasso in The Metropolitan Museum of Art,"" featuring 250 of the artist's works. While there is no right way to repair a painting - each piece demands a different approach - some principles are paramount in the fine art of art restoration, experts say. First, do no harm ""The first principle of conservation is to minimize intervention,"" says James Hamm, interim director of the Art Conservation Department at Buffalo State University. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it. We do as little as possible because the more we get our hands in it, the more chance for wear and tear. The art is supposed to live longer than us.""Once conservators assess the best way to repair the damage while minimizing intervention, they clean flaking paint and dust. ""It's kind of like cleaning a cut,"" says independent art restorer Patrick Mahoney. ""The first thing you have to do is clean the painting.""Restorers may use a soft brush to clean the front of the painting, and a hand-held vacuum to pick up debris on the back. Liquids are rarely used for cleaning because they may seep into the canvas and distort the paint.Because Picasso's paint tends to be applied in thick strokes, the paint is likely to have suffered extensive flaking, says Mr. Mahoney. In such a case, a restorer would use a pH-neutral, polyvinyl acetate adhesive to ""glue"" the paint back onto the canvas and prevent it from flaking off completely.When the visitor fell into the canvas, she not only created a large tear, she also created a dent in the canvas. The Met's restoration team may humidify the canvas using a ventilation system consisting of a damp cloth suspended under plastic mylar, to ""bring it back into plane,"" says Mr. Hamm of Buffalo State University.Sewing up the tear In some cases, experts will try to repair the tear using a technique called re-weaving, in which the frayed threads of the ripped canvas are painstakingly woven together.""The frayed yarns would be pulled back together, one at a time, with adhesive and tweezers - under microscope, of course,"" explains Hamm. ""It makes eye surgery look easy. It is tedious, but there's only one of these paintings, so the effort is worth it.""In extreme cases, the frayed yarns of the canvas would be clipped and a stiff linen patch applied to the back of the canvas to provide support and adhere the torn ends together. The last step, Hamm says, is touching up the front of the painting where paint is missing. Restorers usually use a resin-based paint to mimic an oil paint's texture and shine. If the painting was varnished, conservators will apply a varnish after the paint has dried.The job may take days or months, depending on the damage. The Met will probably use its own in-house conservators, but if they use independent experts, the job would likely be billed at around $100 per hour, say experts.Once it's done, Met visitors will likely be none the wiser.""If it's well-done, you won't even know it's there,"" says Hamm. ""It's a funny business - we work very hard to make our work look invisible.""--- Follow us on Twitter.

Among the 23 Americans exhibited, Johns provides the best mirror for Picasso's versatility, as he quotes both directly and indirectly from Picasso's pictures, making art that shares Picasso's omnivorous taste both in materials (wax, string, wood, sand) and in subject matter (space, death, and, most famously, testicles). At four decades and counting, Johns's relationship to Picasso is also the most sustained. As theoretical and commercial savvy are increasingly emphasized in the academy, outright visual sophistication has become strangely suspect. As a result, not only Picasso-inspired images but the values Picasso embodied as a painter - sure-handed drawing, material virtuosity, and a sense of formal adventure - have become harder to find in the art world.

He is the art critic for the journal n+1 and the founding editor of Paper Monument, an art journal launching in the spring. PABLO PICASSO'S spell over 20th-century art can perhaps be summed up in five words spoken by the Armenian-American painter Arshile Gorky in 1934. Informed that Picasso had recently started making messier paintings, the very tidy Gorky famously replied, ""If Picasso drips, I drip."" Picasso's staggering output - more than 20,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and photographs - gave him an exposure unprecedented for a living artist. The fact that he spearheaded the century's most important movement (cubism), invented its defining technique (collage), and painted its most imposing masterpiece (""Guernica"") makes it hard to think of any modern artist - including rivals and elders - who didn't at some point in his career take cues from Picasso's Paris studio. If modernism had a pope, it was Picasso. New York's Whitney Museum of American Art is currently displaying an ambitious exhibition that carefully chronicles the Catalan's tremendous importance to this country's major 20th-century artists. But the exhibit - ""Picasso and American Art,"" on display through Jan. 28 - confines itself to artistic relationships begun during Picasso's lifetime, which excludes anyone who wasn't already making mature work by 1973. Understandably, curator Michael FitzGerald told me he had both ""practical and intellectual reasons"" for limiting an already expansive show to artists who ""risked a response"" from the living master, but the inevitable question arises: What has become of Picasso's influence in the 33 years since his death? As the Whitney show demonstrates, Picasso had many interesting and conscientious protgs in his prime, but fewer people followed, or even knew, his work from the 1960s and '70s. By the time Picasso died, most American artists were following his followers instead. In the '80s and '90s, a fierce critique of modernism had rendered its central figure somewhat suspect in the American academy, and the subsequent rise of new media - video, installation, and performance art - made the painter's achievements less than relevant. It would therefore be easy - and true - to say that Picasso's impact on the contemporary art scene has dramatically declined. But when you talk with younger artists and gallery owners today, you find a renewed interest in Picasso. It seems more accurate to say his influence has dispersed rather than diminished - and that the story of his influence is ongoing. . . . Paintings of fractured dark forests and African figurines open the Whitney exhibit, as pioneering Yankee modernists like Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, and Stuart Davis start grappling with Picasso in 1911, only a few years after he invented cubism. Desperate to wake America from the provincial dream of realism, these artists used the liberated geometric structure of Picasso's landscapes to build their own, distinctly American spaces, complete with enchanted trees, bright ads, and big signatures. This early mix of European sophistication and American energy sets the stage for the trio of migrs - Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, and John Graham - who would translate Picasso's ideas into the first truly influential school of American painting, Abstract Expressionism, in the 1940s. We watch as Picasso's fractured and angular spatial framework gradually morphs into the Americans' more sweeping and tactile gestures. This slow germination erupts a few years later in Jackson Pollock's totally liquefied splatter paintings, whose vertiginous freedom completes the journey from Picasso's Mediterranean to the wild west. Having triumphantly wrested the center of the art world from the School of Paris, the so-called New York School gave way to the Pop generation - Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jasper Johns - who had to contend with the master in the '60s and early '70s, when his imagery was already firmly embedded in the popular imagination. It would seem only natural to make copies of a painter who himself was known to improvise on paintings by the old masters, but while Picasso's versions of Velazquez and Poussin were enthusiastic reinventions, Lichtenstein and Warhol emphasized the quote marks, making deadpan variations on pictures - of weeping women, guitars, and nude bathers - that were now unassailable icons of European culture. Warhol's blowups of Picasso drawings lack the punch of his Campbell's cans or Jackie O's, but Lichtenstein starts some pretty peculiar dialogues by inserting his dot-matrix blondes in surrealist landscapes and having a Picasso-style face stare blankly past its frame at the brushy Abstract Expressionist style by which it had just been eclipsed. Like Lichtenstein's blowups of lowly comic strips, his versions of Picasso paintings strike a strange balance between homage and critique, but Lichtenstein's trademark ambivalence functions more irreverently when directed at high art. This aiming at Picasso, rather than for him, was entirely new. Jasper Johns's engagement with Picasso - as represented at the Whitney by 21 pieces that range from simple pencil sketches to an elegant suite in homage to 1953's ""The Shadow"" - takes these mixed feelings even further. Among the 23 Americans exhibited, Johns provides the best mirror for Picasso's versatility, as he quotes both directly and indirectly from Picasso's pictures, making art that shares Picasso's omnivorous taste both in materials (wax, string, wood, sand) and in subject matter (space, death, and, most famously, testicles). At four decades and counting, Johns's relationship to Picasso is also the most sustained. Mostly gray, his pictures use diagramatic arrangements, shallow space, and muted tones to take questions that Picasso boldly asked - What is space? What is death? What is sex? - and rephrase them more stoically. As with Johns's famous flags, maps, and targets, which he often painted in a single color, his careful neutralization of Picasso images somehow helps us see them better. At 76, Johns is the youngest living artist represented in the show, and his pictures are the only ones exhibited from the last decade. And yet, although Johns's work reveals a lot about Picasso, it only gives us the vaguest clue about his influence in the present, leaving the impression, unintended no doubt, that Picasso's influence suddenly trailed off. . . . Indeed, when art-world people are asked to name the biggest influence on today's art making, Picasso's name doesn't exactly leap to mind. ""We're the Warhol generation, not the Picasso generation,"" says Joshua Buckno, a young curator who works at Boston's Nielsen Gallery. Roger White, a painter and critic who attended Columbia University's influential MFA program, ascribes Picasso's waning influence to Warhol's French antecedent, Marcel Duchamp. For a generation forced to grapple constantly with mass culture, artists who could turn a urinal or a soup can into art seem more relevant than a man who obsessed over African masks. Duchamp's methods - pranks and puzzles that always emphasized the conceptual over the visual - are especially prevalent in today's graduate-level art programs, where, according to White, ""one is learning to talk about art as much as make it."" Richard Ryan, a professor of painting at Boston University who started teaching at Yale in the 1980s, also notices Picasso's relative absence in academia. ""You don't hear Picasso's name mentioned as much as you used to,"" says Ryan. He sees this as something of a mistake, ""because if you get involved with the basics of visual representation - space, color, form - he's always there before you are."" As theoretical and commercial savvy are increasingly emphasized in the academy, outright visual sophistication has become strangely suspect. As a result, not only Picasso-inspired images but the values Picasso embodied as a painter - sure-handed drawing, material virtuosity, and a sense of formal adventure - have become harder to find in the art world. Of course, Picasso was himself a savvy self-promoter and very much a trickster - indeed, Duchamp's early work came right out of Picasso - so his ""disappearance"" may simply show how his personality and intellectual legacy have had more effect on recent art than his pictures. Nevertheless, a resurgent interest in representational painting - on the part of collectors and curators as well as artists - suggests that this might be changing. New York gallery owner Zach Feuer, who represents several Picasso-inspired painters, thinks the generation that was taught to critique modernism - its domination by men, its cults of personality, its complicity with colonialism - is ""now also ready to address many of its appealing aspects."" Feuer points to Picasso's amazing range as what gives younger artists ""an entry point to dealing with modern art sincerely."" With an artist as prolific as Picasso, it would indeed be strange not to find something you genuinely admired, and decades of hindsight give artists the freedom to mine inspiration from the fullness of a career that lasted almost 80 years. From the multiple-panel ""cubist"" portraits of Chicago-based photographer Dawoud Bey to painter Scott Grodesky's beguiling tricks with reverse perspective, some artists are idiosyncratically continuing Picasso's cubist legacy. Others - like New York painters Carroll Dunham, Cecily Brown, and the late Jean-Michel Basquiat - have taken a lot from the manic and bawdy pictures at the other end of Picasso's career. Dana Schutz, who is represented by Feuer, says she admires Picasso ""precisely for his versatility"" and has taken lessons from his entire oeuvre: ""freed up color, contradictory spaces, and liberatingly poor taste."" And although her pictures of pill-poppers and self-devourers look very much like updated versions of his weeping women, Schutz emphasizes that her encounter with Picasso has lacked the sense of confrontation it had for previous generations. ""I never had the feeling I had to 'get past' Picasso,"" she says. ""It was a more playful kind of influence."" With Picasso now more of a grandfather than a father figure, this attitude - respectful but more relaxed - may be typical of an updated stance toward the Spanish master. Instead of responding reverently to his latest discoveries, like Gorky, or irreverently to his accumulated status, like Lichtenstein, contemporary artists are choosing when and how to engage him on their own terms. If Picasso's creative lawlessness - his mixed-media zigzag of furious innovation - gave rise to a chaotic art world where it seems impossible to trace the sundry ramifications of his work, it has also clearly left a rich and varied archive for future generations. And while some of his influence on contemporary art will undoubtedly remain invisible, there have already been enough responses since Picasso left the scene for us to hope that one day we'll see a fascinating sequel to the Whitney's landmark show.Word count: 1772Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Based on the provided news article content, I would classify the impact on Pablo Picasso's reputation, visibility, and market confidence as ""High."" The article highlights the landmark exhibition at New York's Whitney Museum that traces Picasso's influence on 20th-century American art, which suggests a significant enhancement of his reputation in the art world. Additionally, the mention of Picasso being the most influential artist of the last century implies that he continues to have a profound impact on contemporary art, thereby increasing his visibility among collectors, galleries, and the general public. The article also has the potential to boost market confidence in the artist's work as a sound investment, as it highlights the enduring relevance of his work.",

Because although artist and fashion designer Helen Steele was wild, she was not promiscuous. She tells Barry Egan about drunken driving accidents, conquering dyspraxia and branching into wearable art with her husband's duck company. Photography by Kip Carroll. Styling by Liadan HynesPainting is just another way of keeping a diary, Pablo Picasso said. Helen Steele's diary is filled to the brim. She is in demand both as an artist and as a fashion designer. She is a latter-day Renaissance Woman.Her work and her time are much sought after. With the side of her head shaved, Helen looks like an alternative Caprice. She has a punkish attitude that matches her edgy hairdo.She is not reluctant in saying that her artwork has been collected by the likes of Diane von Furstenberg, Helena Christensen, and Donald Sutherland. ""It is a bit cheesy to name who collects your work in the art world,"" she says. ""It's like an unwritten rule. Well, feck the rules; that's a load of snobbish bollocks.""You could never accuse Helen Steele of being a load of snobbish bollocks. The blonde Venus perched opposite me in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin is an extraordinary character. And I don't think there will be anyone, once they read to the end of this article, who will dare disagree with this claim.Represented by HF Contemporary Art London and Berlin, Bait Muzna in Oman and thejamjar in Dubai, Helen has shown at Art Basel Miami Beach; and, she beams, also at the first Art Paris Abu Dhabi, where the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi purchased her work for his own private collection and also for the state collection. ""That was kind of funny seeing your work on billboards alongside Warhols and Wang Yan Cheng,"" she smiles.She cites artists such as Hermann Nitsch as a heavy influence on her work. According to the Saatchi Gallery website, happy Hermann reformed the face of Sixties art, shunning the illusionary confines of traditional painting and sculpture, reinventing an art that exists in real, corporeal, and violent terms.""I have worked professionally for 10 years as an action artist, heavily influenced by the Viennese activists like Hermann Nitsch. Without the violence, I would like to add,"" Helen says. "" I like his purist, nearly religious relationship with paint."" This influence, Helen adds, helped her to create violently bright, beautiful images -- captured through video performance -- of a multitude of incompatible paints being propelled into the air at speed, using various methods such as chainsaws, fireworks, wind machines and forklifts. The images were worked on for weeks to create the perfect prints.""So,"" she enthuses, ""the passion deep within for fashion finally got the better of me and, after collaborations with Harvey Nichols Dublin and UK and Vogue [Fashion's Night Out 2010], Brown Thomas, and Joanne Hynes and I worked on a project called Les Guerriers for autumn/winter 2011 combining art and fashion.""Helen explains that she designed a selection of prints and T-shirts and leggings and some dresses for the collaborative project. The collection, she adds, was purchased by stockists internationally during Paris Fashion Week.""And now I'm working on launching my own label of ready-to-wear W.A.R.T. -- wearable art,"" she says, adding that the project is run in conjunction with Silver Hill Foods -- who supply the feathers -- the University of Ulster and their fashion department and research lab.Inspired, she says, by the clothing of the north-Atlantic islands, the label will be given her own name. ""We are developing ready-to-wear duck-down-filled parkas and puffas,"" she says.""The duck-down is our own, and we aim to test duck fat as an outer-shell wax that's windproof, water- and damp-proof, but breathable enough to wear the outer shell during the summer. The inner shell is filled with snuggly pure Irish duck-down, and is detachable. The outer shells come in prints or plain colours too.""It is inspired by the Eskimos,"" she continues, ""who initially used seal skin in the first parkas and coated them in fish oils to waterproof the outer shell. I also want to tackle taking the Sloane out of the puffa and make them cool again in more abstract shapes, using leather and polyamide too.""This 2012 collection, called Nucleus, will be at the London showroom and sales room of luxury fashion sales agency Snow next month, and will debut at London and Paris Fashion Weeks in September and October.All this talk of duck-down and the like is, let me explain, inspired by her husband, the legendary Irish duck farmer Stuart Steele,who runs Silver Hill Foods, a company founded over 49 years ago by Stuart's parents, Ronnie and Lyla Steele. (Silver Hill Foods' duck, Helen tells me proudly, was selected by Heston Blumenthal to feature on his TV show In Search of Perfection.) Helen was only 23 when she started going out with the esteemed Monaghan duck guru; a mere six weeks later, they got engaged. Stuart proposed to Helen on March 9, 1996, in his sister's bathroom in Monaghan.Three months later, they were married in Maynooth, on June 21, 1996, in the same church the bride was christened in. The reception was held in the family home, which was just across the road.""If my daughter came to me and said she was getting married to a guy after three months, I'd put her on a plane, to be honest, but it was right for me. I was so drawn to him, like nothing on earth -- we were just really, really lucky. I had never met anyone like him before. We were lucky in the paths we chose. We had a chance to have our kids young,"" Helen says, referring to Chloe, 14, Halle, eight, and Ronnie, six. ""I have never met anyone like Stuart.""And what is he like, your duck-rearing husband?""He is brilliant in every way,"" she beams. ""Clever, funny, kind. He was very, very driven. And I really liked that. And really sure of himself.""Helen met her future husband while on a date in Cafe En Seine, on Dublin's Dawson Street, with his friend. Stuart's girlfriend at that time had arranged the blind date. As sometimes happens in these situations, Helen connected with Stuart instead.A couple of months later, Stuart and his girlfriend split up. Stuart started coming into Milano on Dawson Street where Helen was waitressing. She can remember saying to her friend Victoria, who was working with her in the restaurant: ""I'm going to marry him."" Victoria's reaction indicated a certain shock: ""What, your man with the big schnoz?""Helen's father was shocked too, as it turned out. ""When Stuart phoned my dad to ask for my hand in marriage,"" she remembers, ""my dad immediately turned to my mother and said: 'Stuart is after phoning. He wants to come down and talk to me. I bet she has written off another car.' That's what they thought it was about.""At that time, Helen was also the lead singer in a sub-Patti-Smith-in-the-Velvet-Underground kind of band called Wootcher Bronx, which is slang for psychotic ex-girlfriend. Helen's psychotic Patti Smith-style wailing at one particularly inauspicious gig in 1996 in Eamon Doran's in Temple Bar so inspired someone in the audience that he threw a pint glass of urine at her.""The lyrics weren't supposed to make any sense; it was a fantastic statement,"" she laughs. ""So, we got pissed on."" The band soldiered on for three years, finally stopping when Helen had a miscarriage.Helen and your man with the big schnoz now live happily on a duck farm in rural Monaghan -- home to Ireland's yummiest duck, Silver Hill Foods and their three amazing children. When she was but a big child herself, 17-year-old punky ingenue Helen drove a black Ford Fiesta that had Radiohead or Nirvana permanently blaring out of the abused tape-player inside. ""The old car had been in 11 car crashes,"" she says. "" All of them with me behind the wheel.""What's that Bowie song from Low -- Always Crashing In The Same Car?""It's true,"" she splutters. ""People would not get in the car with me. I don't blame them.""I enquire when the last of the 11 mash-ups was. I wasn't expecting the honest reply that I get.""The last car crash scared the crap out of me,"" she answers. ""I basically had drink on me and I drove, and there were loads of us in the car. I was about 21 at the time. It was the most stupid thing. I even knew getting into the car that I had too much drink on me. It was in Blackrock in Dublin, where we crashed. I realised there and then that I could have killed my sister and my friends. I shouldn't have been behind a wheel.""Freewheelin' Helen was brought up in an old house beside the grain mill in Maynooth -- her family were grain merchants, going back to 1850. ""We used to see spooky sightings in our house. Freaky stuff that would scare the wits out of you,"" she recalls.""There was one particular room that no one would sleep in, so it became the guest room. Very hospitable,"" Helen laughs, adding that from when she was 12 she ""slept with a crucifix under my pillow for -- Jesus -- eleven years! I was terrified. The room was really cold.""Helen would see the severe lack of warmth as some sign of demonic possession within the four walls of her unbeloved bedroom. ""Weird stuff would happen, like the presses would open by themselves in the night in the summer without any wind and then close by themselves.""My mum only told me a few months ago that my grandmother died in the bed that I used to sleep in,"" Helen continues. ""But I never felt scared in that bed, but I always felt scared in the house. If I was by myself I would be absolutely terrified, and this was until my late teens. In general, there was an atmosphere in the house that you couldn't explain.""Helen, who was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 1974, is the second eldest: she has an older brother, Ted, who was born in 1971 and then younger siblings, Sarah and Paul. ""I never saw ghosts in the house,"" she says, ""but my sister did and my older brother did. I used to beg my sister to sleep in the room with me. Beg!""Asked what her mother thought about all this, Helen says, revealingly perhaps: ""I was pretty prone to embellishment, and still am. So my mum thought I was making it up quite a bit.""Maybe the ghosts were helping your creativity by giving you something to embellish about?""Now you are really freaking me out. But I think that is part of being an artist, isn't it? A slight bit of embellishment, whether verbal or how you are creating a painting, is good,"" she says. ""Creativity is just another part of the imagination, and it's channelling creative energy."" All of which the young Helen had, perhaps, too much of. She was banned from drinking Coca-Cola: she was fizzy enough. As a child, Helen was -- deep breath -- hyperactive, bold, wild, troublesome. ""Why not?"" she laughs. ""I was always in trouble.""What's the worst trouble you were ever in?""I can't really say."" She shoots me a guilty look.""OK . . . poo in the post to people,"" she says eventually, before clarifying: ""Dog poo. To someone who was basically beating my sister, Sarah, up in school when she was seven or eight. I actually know her quite well, and I confessed a couple of years later -- she didn't seem to mind. In fact, it wasn't her who opened the letter. So it was pretty grim. I have never actually told Sarah this story.""What else have you done that would have been bad, Helen?She looks a me a bit sheepishly. ""OK. Shaved the school dog. Another time, actually, I was going out with a guy . . .""I stop Helen to confirm, before she goes any further, that this next story doesn't involve shaving. Or dogs. Or poo.""No,"" she reassures me. ""I wanted to play an April Fool on him. So I phoned his message minder in his flat and said that I had smelt gas in the apartment and then I phoned the police and said there was a gas leak. Basically, I heard on the news later on that day, as I was coming home from college, that they had cornered a certain part of Dublin because of an apparent gas leak; there was no gas leak.""Helen was 18. She says that she thinks she genuinely had too much energy -- when she was a child, her mum used to put her outside and tell her to do eight laps of the garden just to calm her down. ""I'm dyspraxic,"" she says of the developmental disorder characterised by impaired motor skills, ""and I was diagnosed only eight years ago so, as you can imagine, school was a roller coaster for me."" As it was for the nuns at Helen's boarding school in Rathnew, Co Wicklow, where her parents dispatched her when she was 12 to get her out of the house.Helen says she was always creative. Painting, drawing and doodling all through school. ""It was the only thing I was good at apart from English and French. So I could snog French boys."" But, it transpires, nothing more than that. Helen says the nuns and her parents had her petrified about sex. ""I was wild but not sexually promiscuous. I was absolutely terrified of . . . just Catholicism. And terrified of getting pregnant young. So I was terrified of sex. In fact, when I got married, on our honeymoon I told my husband to turn the lights off.""Unusual from someone who spends most of her time brightening up the world.LDress, Stella McCartney, Helen's ownPage 13Dress; collar, both Eilis Boyle, BowDress, Eilis Boyle, Bow.Mask, Edel Ramberg; boots YSL, both Harvey NicholsTop, Acne; shoes, Alexander McQueen, both Brown Thomas Dublin.Necklace, MoMuse, Bow.Trousers, Helen's ownBow, Powerscourt Townhouse Centre, D2, tel: (01) 707-1763, or see www.bowboutique.iePhotography by Kip CarrollStyling by Liadan HynesAssisted by Jennifer O'DwyerHair and make-up by Paula Callan-O'KeeffeCAPTION: Cover and this pageCAPTION: Page 14 and Contents pageWord count: 2434Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Walter killed herself four years after Picasso died in 1973, still distraught that he had never legally married her.The two tableaux that were taken were of Picasso's daughter Maya and his second wife Jacqueline, and are worth an estimated dollars66 million (GBP34m). Of the 13,000 paintings and designs, 100,000 prints, 300 sculptures and 34,000 book illustrations Picasso produced it is estimated that around 550 have been stolen from their rightful owners.Antonia Kimbell of the Art Loss Register described the Paris theft as ""definitely quite significant"".""Anything of particularly good quality, with the provenance of his granddaughter, would reach considerable value on the open market, "" she said, before adding that it was ""unlikely a legitimate dealer would purchase or acquire any of these pieces"".Johnathan Sazonoff, an expert in missing art, explained that such work would be ""very hard to fence because it's so well-known . . . stealing a Picasso is like stealing a sign that says, 'I'm a thief '.""Art expert Charles Dupplin agreed that it would be impossible for thieves to sell the paintings on the open market.""It will be impossible to sell these iconic works openly . . . in recent years we have seen some evidence of stealing to order in various European countries. This may well be what is happening here.""Picasso's work has steadily risen in value in the decades since he died and, although he was prolific, some items have soared in value, depending on whether the artist kept them during his lifetime or allowed them to be sold on the open market.Pepe Karmel, an associate professor at New York University, said the two works were among the paintings divided between his immediate heirs on his death (he had four children with three different women), which might explain why Widmaier-Picasso had possession of the work not depicting her grandmother, but instead Picasso's second wife.Adolf the art thiefThe Nazi's plundered thousands of collections during the time of the Third Reich, from 1933 to 1944. In addition to cash, religious treasures, paintings, rare books and gold were taken from museums and the collections of Jewish families.While thousands of items were lost during the looting (some estimates say as much as 20per cent of ""Western"" art was stolen during the period), others were sold for profit and some given to high-ranking Nazi officials. Adolf Hitler, himself a failed artist, had a grand scheme for a huge art museum which was never realised, however, thousands of pieces were stored away in anticipation of the Fhrermuseum.As the Allies closed in on Germany at the end of the war, many pieces were moved and hundreds hidden in unsuitable environments, including salt mines.Some of the items have, of course, ended up in Britain. Several museums, including the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, have found that items in their collections came to the UK after being looted by the Nazis. However, that is no guarantee they will be returned: a High Court ruling in 2005 prevented Old Master paintings being returned to their original owners because they could not guarantee their posterity, which our Museums Act does.Some works are still being uncovered. Last year a Gustav Klimt painting became the most expensive artwork ever sold when it was bought by a New York gallery for GBP73 million.It had been returned to the niece of the rightful owner by an Austrian museum who had had it on display since it was stolen from the family in 1938.The day her smile disappearedYou might think that, being one of the most famous paintings in the world, all eyes would be on the Mona Lisa pretty much all of the time.However, Leonardo da Vinci's most famous work was missing for an entire day in 1911 before anyone noticed it had gone from the Louvre, and even then hours passed before anyone was sure it was stolen.After a week of investigations and interviews with present and former members of staff (Pablo Picasso was even questioned), the Louvre re-opened and queues of people came to silently stare at the empty space on the wall where it had hung. One person even left a bouquet of flowers. The police were convinced the painting had been lost forever.The scheme to steal the Mona Lisa was in fact part of a complex scam masterminded by con artist Eduardo de Valierno.He convinced Vincenzo Peruggia, who had been employed months before to fit glass on to the frames of several paintings at the Louvre, to steal the painting and give it to a forger to copy.De Valierno planned to sell forgeries of the painting all over the world as the stolen original, but Peruggia grew tired of waiting for him to contact him. After two years living quietly in an apartment in Florence, where he had the Mona Lisa on display, Peruggia tried to sell the painting himself to an art dealer, and was promptly arrested. It was returned to the Louvre in 1913.The Mona Lisa is now undoubtedly one of the best protected pieces of art in the world.However, its popularity brings its own problems.Last month, Louvre guards threatened to strike because of the stress of dealing with 65,000 visitors a day who are trying to view the painting, and having to tell each of them that photography is not allowed. The union for the guards blamed the success of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code for prompting a boom in visitors.How the Greeks 'lost' their marblesWhether or not the Elgin Marbles were stolen by Britain might depend on how you define theft.Also known as the Parthenon Marbles, the Elgin Marbles are a large collection of sculptures removed from Athens to the UK in 1816 by Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin. Elgin was the ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the turn of the century . . . the empire at that time ruled over Greece. Elgin obtained authority from the Ottoman sultan to remove the sculptures, and they were shipped to Britain and sold to the British Museum for GBP35,000. The parts moved to the UK take in about two-thirds of the massive marble display.But a very modern protest grows around the priceless works of art, and it is gathering pace. Several legal challenges have been launched against the continued presence of the marbles in Britain, and the New Acropolis Museum in Athens has been constructed with spaces left pointedly empty for ""when"" the pieces are returned.However, a test case relating to other works dented the chances of the sculptures being returned by purely legal mechanisms, when the High Court ruled in 2005 that the moral obligation of museums to return cultural artefacts is overruled by the need to preserve rare objects for posterity. The pollution levels in Athens, which have damaged the remaining pieces of sculpture, seem to seal that argument. Despite this, there are frequent protests in Greece about the British Museum, most recently in January when 2000 university students formed a human chain around the Acropolis to demand that they be returned.The take-away Rembrandt When Jacob de Gheyn III sat for his portrait with the Dutch old master Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, little did he know that he was destined to be the subject of the most stolen artwork in history.Owned by London's Dulwich Picture Gallery, the painting has been stolen four times since 1966, the most recorded of any painting.After the first two occasions it was stolen, the painting was recovered from underneath a bench in a graveyard in Streatham and on the back of a bicycle.Each time, the painting was returned anonymously, with no-one ever being charged with its disappearance.At the end of August 1981, the painting was stolen from the gallery but was retrieved when police arrested four men in a taxi who had the painting with them.Less than two years later, a burglar smashed a skylight to access the gallery, then used a crowbar to prise the painting from the wall. The police arrived within three minutes but were too late to apprehend the thief. The painting was missing for three years, eventually being found in October 1986 in a luggage rack at the train station of a British Army garrison in Munster, Germany.The Da Vinci cock-upIn 2003, one of the most daring raids in art-theft history was carried out right here in Scotland, at Drumlanrig Castle, home of the Duke of Buccleuch.Two men posing as tourists (captured on CCTV, below) paid the GBP6 entry fee to the castle and after a leisurely stroll around the building snatched Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna With The Yarnwinder from the staircase gallery, where it was hanging on display. After overpowering a female guide, the men ran out to a waiting car and escaped with the painting, valued at around GBP40 million.When alarmed tourists spotted them jumping over a wall with the painting, one of the robbers shouted back ""Don't worry love, we're the police. This is just a practice.""The Duke of Buccleuch is one of the richest men in Britain, and his fine art collection includes masterpieces by Rembrandt and Holbein. It is understood, however, that he received just GBP3m from his insurers to cover the loss of the painting.Although Interpol were enlisted to help with the search, and an all-ports alert was issued for the men spotted during the theft, neither the raiders nor the painting have been recovered.The painting was bought in Italy in the 18th century by the third Duke of Buccleuch and was conclusively identified as a work by the Renaissance master in 1986 after forensic testing.The Scream scamThe Scream (1893) is the best known work by Edvard Munch, the Norwegian painter who was one of the first artists to depict abstract emotions on the canvas.The Scream, in fact, exists in several versions depicting the same scene . . . it was common for Munch to paint several versions of important pieces. It was originally called Despair and was part of a series of paintings that depicted life, death and fear. They took him more than a decade to complete.Despite often suffering acute anxiety, Munch was a prolific artist and, after many years in Germany, he retired to Oslo where he died aged 80 in 1944.He left 1000 paintings, 15,400 prints, 4500 drawings and watercolours, and six sculptures to the city of Oslo, which built the Munch Museum at Tyen.One version of The Scream was stolen in 1994, and another in 2004.In the 1994 theft, it took less than a minute for thieves to smash into the National Art Museum in Oslo, cut the (uninsured) painting from the wall and escape. It happened on the first day of the Winter Olympics in Norway, causing a media frenzy.Suspicion was initially directed at a radical anti-abortion group who claimed responsibility.Some months later, the gallery received a dollars1 million ransom demand, which they refused to pay. In May 1994, the painting was found during a joint sting by British and Norwegian police.Four people were convicted in 1996. One of the thieves, Paal Enger, is now a legitimate art buyer.In August 2004, another version of The Scream was stolen in Oslo along with Munch's The Madonna, this time from the Munch Museum.Three men were found guilty of charges relating to the theft of the two paintings by a court in Norway in May 2006, but they are appealing their conviction.Both The Scream and The Madonna were recovered last year. Both had suffered minor damage. Now they are back on display at the museum, this time in heavy glass cases.Credit: Newsquest Media GroupWord count: 2065Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Delays, cost overruns and the management style of the museum's former president Anne Baldassari were hot gossip in the art world. Baldassari clung to her job, with the support of Picasso's son Claude, the patriarch of the family.The scandal went public in May, when the newspaper Lib ration leaked an internal report critical of Baldassari. More than half the museum's 40 staff signed a petition denouncing her ""authoritarianism, partiality and managerial methods, which have led the Picasso Museum into an impasse"". The government sacked her.""This museum has been sorely missed on the Parisian art scene,"" says Stphane Gugan, a curator at the Muse d'Orsay and the author of a new bibliography of Picasso. At least three-quarters of the books in Gugan's biography are by US and British authors. ""It's time the French reclaimed Picasso,"" Gugan says.Nothing involving Picasso has ever been simple. When he died, in April 1973, Picasso left a fortune estimated at the equivalent of 660 million. He was survived by his second wife, Jacqueline, three former mistresses, four children and six grandchildren. It took more than six years for the family to divide the estate.In lieu of inheritance tax the family gave France first choice of 5,000 artworks. The Picasso Museum opened in the 17th-century Htel Sl in the Marais district of Paris in 1985.Laurent Le Bon, who was appointed to replace Baldassari, invited her to curate the first exhibition in the renovated museum. She eventually accepted, with spectacular results. The museum has doubled its exhibition space and increased the number of works on display from 200 to 450.During a recent visit to the museum, Baldassari denies there have been delays in the renovation. She financed 31 million of the 53 million cost by sending parts of the collection around the world during the closure. Baldassari says she is totally dedicated to Picasso's legacy, and is deeply wounded by her expulsion from ""her"" museum. ""This has been my life's work,"" she says. ""I believe I've completed it.""Picasso split in three Baldassari has divided the museum into three parts: the cellars represent Picasso's ateliers; the ground, first and second floors are a chronological and thematic record of his art, from his first paintings in 1895, at the age of 14, to his last works in 1973, the year of his death; and on the top floor one can visit Picasso's private collection, comprised of paintings by the men he called his masters - Czanne, Degas, Matisse, Renoir, Rousseau, Mir and Modigliani. This section is almost a museum unto itself.""I paint like others write their autobiography,"" Picasso told Franoise Gilot, who lived with him for a decade and bore him two children. ""I have the impression that time passes ever more quickly. I am like a river that keeps flowing, carrying trees uprooted by the current, dead dogs, rubbish . . . I carry all that and I continue . . . I have less and less time, and more and more to say.""Baldassari filled a room with Picasso's self-portraits. He was only 20, and in the midst of his blue period, when he painted himself as a confident, sombre figure with a wispy, reddish beard. If producing masterpieces at an early age is a criterion of genius, Picasso certainly fulfilled it.In 1938, when the Nazis were burning ""degenerate"" art in Berlin and Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister, demanded that modern artists be sterilised, Picasso reacted by painting himself as van Gogh, whom he regarded as the genius of suffering, with a scarred face and wearing a straw hat. ""It was a very strong affirmation,"" Baldassari says. ""He was saying loud and clear, 'I am a modern artist.' ""Picasso donned van Gogh's straw hat again in a last self-portrait, painted in April 1972. He entitled it The Young Painter , but it's not clear if we are looking at a child, an old man or a cadaver. The eyes are hollow, the complexion blue-grey. In homage to Renoir, whom Picasso considered the genius of colour, Picasso strapped a paintbrush to his hand, the method Renoir used to paint despite severe arthritis.Picasso's women - Fernande Olivier, Olga Khokhlova, Marie-Thrse Walter, Dora Maar, Franoise Gilot and Jacqueline Roque - appear often, in every style that marked Picasso's oeuvre. The early paintings are visibly influenced by Lautrec and van Gogh, followed by the blue and rose periods, cubism, neoclassicism and the surrealist years, which are particularly well represented at the Htel Sl.Marie-Thrse Walter was 17 when Picasso approached her in the Galeries Lafayette department store, saying, ""I would like to paint your portrait. I am Picasso."" He was 45 and married to the ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova.In 1931 he encrypted Walter in a still-life, her eyes and body parts scattered through the painting. The following year he painted a recognisable portrait of her - his way of acknowledging the affair. In the same period, inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses , he began disassembling and distorting his female sitters' features on canvas.Picasso defies classification, says Laurent Le Bon, the new president of the Picasso Museum. He calls the exhibition curated by Baldassari ""a new way of looking at his oeuvre, a sort of ocean"". Picasso ""still surprises us,"" Le Bon says. ""The incredible power of his work is that it doesn't age. It remains very contemporary.""In his book Gugan has tried to nuance some of the myths surrounding Picasso. That of the artist who devours or destroys those closest to him is one of the most tenacious. The tragic legacy was fortified by Picasso's turbulent life and of those around him. Walter and Roque took their own lives; his son Paulo ruined his life with alcohol; and his grandson Pablito died by suicide a few days after Roque refused to allow him to attend Picasso's funeral.Yet Gugan believes Picasso's relationships have been misunderstood. ""There is genuine tenderness when he writes to Marie-Thrse Walter long after their relationship has ended, saying that he will love her always, that he remembers the day they met . . . Women are not only projections of his erotic fantasies. They are an important part of his life, thoughts and politics . . . There is as much tenderness and suffering in the oeuvre of Picasso as there is joy or predatory violence.""Picasso's stature as an artiste engag was guaranteed by his 1937 masterpiece Guernica . His political sensibilities are evident in many works at the Picasso Museum. He painted Cat Seizing a Bird as Madrid fell to Franco's forces in 1939. Massacre in Korea , from 1951, expressed his opposition to the war there.In 1940 Picasso was refused French citizenship because he had associated with anarchists in his youth and was considered a Soviet sympathiser. Four years later he joined the communist party. As Baldassari points out, he was already one of the richest men in the world.Mutual exploitation Gugan sees Picasso's adherence to the communist party as a case of mutual exploitation. The communists wanted to use his status as an artistic star. And, like Jean-Paul Sartre and millions of Frenchmen who survived Nazi occupation, Picasso wanted the appearance of having been a resistant.Picasso was twice awarded the Lenin Prize. In 1965 the British art critic John Berger published The Success and Failure of Picasso . ""He said clearly that Picasso didn't live up to communist party myths,"" Gugan says. ""That he was a bourgeois who painted for bourgeois people and amassed a fortune while letting everyone believe the contrary.""Yet Berger's denunciation was strangely liberating for Picasso. ""When he finally drops the party line, his freedom returns,"" Gugan says. ""The works of his last years were the most torrid. There was a link between the spectre of impotence and this last burst of eroticism - he did in paint what he could no longer do in real life. But, also, the tunnel of Stalinism was over. Despite himself, Picasso had been constrained by the image the communists maintained for him.""

It was true. Before the great artist first visited Saint Raphael in 1919, the Riviera was best known as a winter retreat for pale-skinned Britons, but by the mid-Twenties it had become a fashionable summer destination for the cultural elite. Exiled Russian royals, English aristocrats, European intellectuals and American bohemians streamed to Nice, Cannes, Monaco and Antibes in search of good times.The American socialites Gerald and Sara Murphy - whose motto was 'Living well is the best revenge' - were trendsetters of the era. F. Scott Fitzgerald was so mesmerised by their style that he fictionalised them as Dick and Nicole Diver in his novel Tender Is The Night.The Murphys went to Cap d'Antibes in 1922 to visit Cole Porter, who had hired a villa next to Hotel du Cap. The hotel was then open only in winter, but they persuaded the owner to remain open for the following summer and invited Pablo and Olga Picasso to be their guests. This marked the real beginning of the Riviera boom.Walking into this calm but palatial hotel today and feeling the sea breeze waft through the Bellini Bar, it's hard to see why Riviera summers were ever considered a bad thing. What's not to like about luxurious lawns, a rose garden bordered by mimosa trees, an infinity pool blasted out of the rocks, a dining pavilion that gives you the feeling of being on the deck of a ship, and a regal avenue running down to the ocean's edge? But you have to remember that before the Twenties, a sun tan was a stigma rather than a statement and beaches weren't places to play. Back then, La Plage de la Garoupe - the closest beach to Hotel du Cap - was so strewn with seaweed and stones that the Picassos and Murphys routinely took spades, rakes and a sieve with them to clear space. Tans came into vogue only when Coco Chanel returned to Paris in 1923 with her skin accidentally browned after visiting Cannes on board the Duke of Wellington's yacht.Although Picasso would eventually rue many of the changes his holiday choices had brought about, he didn't stay away. Born in Malaga, he had a lifelong love of the Mediterranean's clear light and bold colours. He was inspired by the forms of bathers, the clarity of shapes lit by the sun and the primal nature of rocks, shells, ocean and sand.In the Twenties he rented villas in Juan les Pins but in the Thirties, on the recommendation of the surrealist poet Paul Eluard, he moved inland to the small hilltop village of Mougins. Here, from his balcony at the Hotel Vaste Horizon, he could see not only the blue of the ocean but the green of cypress groves, the mustard colours of buildings and, in the far distance, the snowwhite tops of the Prealpes.The medieval village of Mougins is a welcome layby from the modern world. The narrow streets are lined with lovingly tended old buildings, many draped in green foliage or fronted by terracotta pots sprouting flowers and bushes. Cats stretch out in the sun knowing that they can remain undisturbed by traffic.If Disney had to create a cute corner of southern France for one of its theme parks, it would probably base it on Mougins.It may well be the Picasso connection that has allowed Mougins to focus on beauty and pleasure. The village has become renowned as a centre for food and art. Almost every commercial outlet is a gallery, a craft store, a restaurant or a grocer's. Each September, international chefs descend to battle it out at the Festival International de la Gastronomie.Its galleries sell everything from ashtrays for tourists to large sculptures for collectors.SOME artists, such as Patrick Duperron, who can be seen painting at his gallery on Rue des Lombards, are obviously influenced by Picasso, but many aren't. Mary Larsson, who shares space with two other female artists at The Mougins Art Studio, was encouraged to paint by the work of Van Gogh and is now inspired by Scandinavian myths and Indian religious philosophy.Picasso remains a presence in Mougins but not an overpowering one. The local hero is AmedeeFrancois Lamy, who was born in Mougins in 1858 and died in battle in 1900. He was a career soldier who served in Algeria, Tunisia and the Congo before helping France conquer Chad - and his statue stands at the entrance to the village.Picasso is more quietly celebrated at the Musee de la Photographie, where the top floor is dedicated to a collection of blackandwhite prints of him (mostly by Andre Villers) taken during the early Fifties.on the outside wall of the building there is a framed poster of him characteristically stripped to the waist, his arms folded over his barrel chest.The Hotel Vaste Horizon, where the artist lived with his lover Dora Maar, Eluard, photographer Man Ray and other kindred spirits in the Thirties, had different names before closing last year. Picasso once decorated the walls of his room here in colourful paints, only to be told by the owner to return it to its original condition. It is now destined to become the town's tourist office and there is nothing to indicate that this was where one of the 20th Century's creative geniuses plotted his future.The Second World War kept Picasso away from the Riviera, but the summer visits restarted after Paris was liberated. In 1946, he came to the annual pottery exhibition at Vallauris, a town just a few miles inland from Golfe Juan. He was particularly intrigued by the work of local ceramicists Suzanne and Georges Ramie and began collaborating with them, supplying designs for their plates, dishes, pitchers, vases, cups and plaques. Two years later, he moved there with his new lover, Francoise Gilot.Vallauris has none of the charm of Mougins. For a Picasso tour of the town, you hardly have to veer from the Avenue Georges Clemenceau that climbs steadily towards a public square. Every other shop you pass sells ceramics.Halfway up, on Rue Ramie, is the now derelict Madoura pottery where Picasso produced 4,000 ceramic works with Suzanne and Georges. The gates are now locked and weeds sprout through the gravel pathway to the front door.In the square stands Picasso's bronze sculpture L'Homme Au Mouton, which he donated to the municipal council. It's a dark, craggy piece that suggests a mood at odds with the children scrambling in front of the library, the old men swallowing their beers and the women exchanging gossip. He never commented on its meaning. It could be the Good Shepherd of the Gospels returning with the lost sheep or merely a peasant with some fresh meat.A few yards away, housed in an old priory, is the Musee National Picasso. It's a grand name for a small and limited collection focused mainly on posters and ceramics created during his five-year stay in the town. There's plenty of space, but not a lot of guidance. There wasn't even a catalogue for sale.In the priory's small chapel, the walls and ceiling of its barrel-vaulted chancel are covered with the wooden panels of a grand fresco, La Guerre Et La Paix, painted by Picasso in 1952. Although large and ambitious, the work seems cursory and the thinly applied paint gives the impression of a job done in a hurry. When Picasso started working with ceramics, he was offered work space at the Palais Grimaldi - Antibes' museum. In gratitude for the city's generosity, Picasso donated many paintings, drawings and ceramic works and in 1947 they went on display.ALMOST 20 years later, the collection having been expanded by further donations and acquisitions, the Palais Grimaldi was renamed Musee Picasso. It's a wonderful place to view Picasso's work, not just because of the spaciousness of the rooms and the building's superb position overlooking the sea, but because almost everything place to view Picasso's work, not just because of the spaciousness of the rooms and the building's superb position overlooking the sea, but because almost everything on display was created locally. What you experience is his wideeyed and joyous embrace of his new Riviera life.Opposite Musee Picasso, at Ceramiques du Chat eau, it is still possible to buy from some of the 633 designs Picasso allowed to be produced in limited editions.They are predominantly dishes from the Fifties and start at around Pounds 1,600. The most expensive plate in the gallery - Scissors And Grapes, produced in 1948 - is unique and signed. It has a price tag of Pounds 50,000.From Vallauris, Picasso moved to Cannes. He had a new woman in his life, Jacqueline Roque, and wanted more space for his work, and more privacy. He bought a huge white villa overlooking the town, which became known as La Californie.Although no longer in the Picasso family, the house remains secluded. It is now called Pavillon de Flore.For the final stage of his life, Picasso went back to Mougins. Tiring of the tourism of Cannes, he bought a house on the side of a hill outside the old village and named it L'Antre du Minautore. He died here in 1973, aged 91.In accordance with his wishes, his body was taken to Vauvenargues, a 14th Century chateau he had bought for Jacqueline in 1958 on the hills outside Aix-en-Provence. He was buried in the grounds, his resting place marked by one of his sculptures.After Jacqueline committed suicide in 1986, she was buried next to him.Last year, for the first time, the public were allowed to view the house which had remained virtually untouched since his death. It is open again this summer until October 2 for visitors who pre-book.Ninety years after his first visit, Picasso is still drawing people to the South of France.WHERE TO SEE PICASSO'S WORK THIS SUMMER...Picasso: Peace and Freedom at Tate Liverpool until August 30, 2010.

In July 2004, as News of the Weird mentioned, a federal appeals court ruled that the leak-safety standards for the long-awaited nuclear waste depository at Nevada's Yucca Mountain were too weak, in that the Environmental Protection Agency would regard the facility as safe for only 10,000 years (almost five times the length of time since the birth of Jesus). One National Academy of Sciences panel had recommended against the site unless leak safety could be certified for at least 300,000 years. In August 2005, EPA issued a revised durability standard, now claiming the site would be free of unsafe leaks for a million years. (Context: 110 years ago, science had not even discovered radioactivity.) VIRTUAL REALITY A Pakistani company, The Resource Group, seeking more call-center work from U.S. firms, set up an office this year in Washington, D.C., a block from the White House, and installed a receptionist, live from Karachi, via a flat-screen TV on the office wall. According to a May Washington Post report, Saadia Musa cheerily greets visitors, answers and routes phone calls to the Washington office, lets in deliverymen, and orders sandwiches from down the street. UGLY DOG CROWNED AGAIN Sam, the 14-year-old Chinese crested, won in June for the third time as the World's Ugliest Dog at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in California. According to an Associated Press reporter, the hairless dog's ""wrinkled brown skin is covered with splotches; a line of warts marches down his snout; his blind eyes are an alien, milky white; and a fleshy flap of skin hangs from his withered neck. And then there's the Austin Powers teeth that jut at odd angles from his mouth."" Owner Susie Lockheed said that even the judges recoiled when they first saw him. (Fortunately, for those concerned with dog beauty, Sam has been neutered.) SHOT AND EVICTED According to police in Jacksonville, N.C., Dorothea Thomas was shot six times by her boyfriend in June and forced to jump from her apartment's second-story balcony to survive, but by the time she returned from the hospital, her landlord of nine years, United Dominion Residential Community, had posted an eviction notice, kicking her out for letting such a dangerous man come onto the property. INCOMPETENT CRIMINALS Jeremy Suggs, 21, was arrested in Las Vegas in August and charged with robbing a Wells Fargo bank, done in by the familiar lapse of having accidentally left behind his wallet and a name-imprinted deposit slip. Also, according to police, he fired two shots in the bank out of frustration at noncompliance with his demands, with one narrowly missing his own head, and had to re-count down a threat to shoot (""5, 4, 3, 2, 1"") when no one gave him money the first time. His alleged partner and getaway driver supposedly had talked him into the crime by assuring him that there were no surveillance cameras, but of course there were. BRIGHT IDEAS The owner of Al's Lock and Safe in North Platte, Neb., made a truck key in June based entirely on looking at an X-ray of the key inside the stomach of Arthur Richardson, who had accidentally swallowed it in an inept attempt to play a prank on the friend of his who owned the truck. The friend said he needed the truck right away and couldn't wait for Arthur to receive a nature's call. GRANNIES AND STREET CRED Grandmother-of-six Mari Savage and other senior friends in Margate, England, began a campaign this summer to wear hooded sweatshirts and baseball caps, to discourage teenagers from dressing that way, which Savage believes encourages gang behavior. Said Savage, to the Daily Telegraph, ""Once older people like us get hold of (these garments), they lose all their street cred.""Word count: 623Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

It was true. Before the great artist first visited Saint Raphael in 1919, the Riviera was best known as a winter retreat for pale-skinned Britons, but by the mid-Twenties it had become a fashionable summer destination for the cultural elite. Exiled Russian royals, English aristocrats, European intellectuals and American bohemians streamed to Nice, Cannes, Monaco and Antibes in search of good times.The American socialites Gerald and Sara Murphy - whose motto was 'Living well is the best revenge' - were trendsetters of the era. F Scott Fitzgerald was so mesmerised by their style that he fictionalised them as Dick and Nicole Diver in his novel Tender Is The Night.The Murphys went to Cap d'Antibes in 1922 to visit Cole Porter, who had hired a villa next to Hotel du Cap. The hotel was then open only in winter but they persuaded the owner to remain open for the following summer and invited Pablo and Olga Picasso to be their guests. This marked the real beginning of the Riviera boom.Walking into this calm but palatial hotel today and feeling the sea breeze waft through the Bellini Bar, it's hard to see why Riviera summers were ever considered a bad thing. What's not to like about luxurious lawns, a rose garden bordered by mimosa trees, an infinity pool blasted out of the rocks, a dining pavilion that gives you the feeling of being on the deck of a ship, and a regal avenue running down to the ocean's edge?But you have to remember that before the Twenties, a sun tan was a stigma rather than a statement and beaches weren't places to play. Back then, La Plage de la Garoupe - the closest beach to Hotel du Cap - was so strewn with seaweed and stones that the Picassos and Murphys routinely took spades, rakes and a sieve with them to clear space. Tans came into vogue only when Coco Chanel returned to Paris in 1923 with her skin accidentally browned after visiting Cannes on board the Duke of Wellington's yacht.Although Picasso would eventually rue many of the changes his holiday choices had brought about, he didn't stay away. Born in Malaga, he had a lifelong love of the Mediterranean's clear light and bold colours. He was inspired by the forms of bathers, the clarity of shapes lit by the sun and the primal nature of rocks, shells, ocean and sand.In the Twenties, he rented villas in Juan les Pins but in the Thirties, on the recommendation of the surrealist poet Paul Eluard, he moved inland to the small hilltop village of Mougins. Here, from his balcony at the Hotel Vaste Horizon, he could see not only the blue of the ocean but the green of cypress groves, the mustard colours of buildings and, in the far distance, the snow-white tops of the Prealpes.The medieval village of Mougins is a welcome layby from the modern world. The narrow streets are lined with lovingly tended old buildings, many draped in green foliage or fronted by terracotta pots sprouting flowers and bushes. Cats stretch out in the sun knowing that they can remain undisturbed by traffic.If Disney had to create a cute corner of southern France for one of its theme parks, it would probably base it on Mougins.It may well be the Picasso connection that has allowed Mougins to focus on beauty and pleasure. The village has become renowned as a centre for food and art. Almost every commercial outlet is a gallery a craft store, a restaurant or a grocer's. Each September, chefs descend to battle it out at the Festival International de la Gastronomie.Its galleries sell everything from ashtrays for tourists to large sculptures for collectors.Some artists, such as Patrick Duperron, who can be seen painting at his gallery on Rue des Lombards, are obviously influenced by Picasso, but many aren't. Mary Larsson, who shares space with two other female artists at The Mougins Art Studio, was encouraged to paint by the work of Van Gogh and is now inspired by Scandinavian myths and Indian religious philosophy.Picasso remains a presence in Mougins but not an overpowering one. The local hero is Amedee-Francois Lamy, who was born in Mougins in 1858 and died in battle in 1900. He was a career soldier who served in Algeria, Tunisia and the Congo before helping France conquer Chad - and his statue stands at the entrance to the village.Picasso is more quietly celebrated at the Musee de la Photographie, where the top floor is dedicated to a collection of black-and-white prints of him (mostly by Andre Villers) taken during the early Fifties.On the outside wall of the building, there is a framed poster of him characteristically stripped to the waist with his arms folded over his barrel chest.The Hotel Vaste Horizon, where Picasso lived with his lover, Dora Maar, Paul Eluard, photographer Man Ray and other kindred spirits in the Thirties, had different names before closing last year. Picasso once decorated the walls of his room here in colourful paints, only to be told by the owner to return it to its original condition.It is now destined to become the town's tourist office and there is nothing to indicate that this was where one of the 20th century's creative geniuses plotted his future.The Second World War kept Picasso away from the Riviera, but the summer visits restarted after Paris was liberated. In 1946, he came to the annual pottery exhibition at Vallauris, a town just a few kilometres inland from Golfe Juan.He was particularly intrigued by the work of local ceramicists Suzanne and Georges Ramie and began collaborating with them, supplying designs for their plates, dishes, pitchers, vases, cups and plaques. Two years later, he moved there with his new lover, Francoise Gilot.Vallauris has none of the charm of Mougins. For a Picasso tour of the town, you hardly have to veer from the Avenue Georges Clemenceau that climbs steadily towards a public square. Every other shop you pass sells ceramics.Halfway up, on Rue Ramie, is the now derelict Madoura pottery where Picasso produced 4,000 ceramic works with Suzanne and Georges. The gates are now locked and weeds sprout through the gravel pathway to the front door.In the square stands Picasso's bronze sculpture L'Homme Au Mouton, which he donated to the municipal council. It's a dark, craggy piece that suggests a mood at odds with the children scrambling in front of the library, the old men swallowing their beers and the women exchanging gossip. He never commented on its meaning. It could be the Good Shepherd of the Gospels returning with the lost sheep or merely a peasant with some fresh meat.Afew metres away, housed in an old priory, is the Musee National Picasso. It's a grand name for a small and limited collection focused mainly on posters and ceramics created during his five-year stay in the town. There's plenty of space, but not a lot of guidance. There wasn't even a catalogue for sale.In the priory's small chapel, the walls and ceiling of its barrelvaulted chancel are covered with the wooden panels of a grand fresco, La Guerre Et La Paix, painted by Picasso in 1952. Although large and ambitious, the work seems cursory and the thinly applied paint gives the impression of a job done in a hurry.When Picasso started working with ceramics, he was offered work space at the Palais Grimaldi - Antibes' museum. In gratitude for the city's generosity, Picasso donated many paintings, drawings and ceramic works and in 1947 they went on display. Almost 20 years later, its collection having been expanded by further donations and acquisitions, the Palais Grimaldi was renamed Musee Picasso.It's a wonderful place to view Picasso's work, not just because of the spaciousness of the rooms and the building's superb position overlooking the sea, but because almost everything on display was created locally. What you experience is his wide-eyed and joyous embrace of his new Riviera life.Opposite Musee Picasso, at Ceramiques du Chateau, it is still possible to buy from some of the 633 designs Picasso allowed to be produced in limited editions. They are predominantly dishes from the Fifties and start at about EUR 2,000. The most expensive plate in the gallery - Scissors And Grapes, produced in 1948 - is unique and signed. It has a price tag of EUR 60,000.From Vallauris, Picasso moved to Cannes. He had a new woman in his life, Jacqueline Roque, and wanted more space for his work and more privacy. He bought a huge white villa overlooking the town, which became known as La Californie. Although no longer in the Picasso family, the house remains secluded. It is now called Pavillon de Flore.For the final stage of his life, Picasso went back to Mougins.Tiring of the tourism of Cannes, he bought a house on the side of a hill outside the old village and named it L'Antre du Minautore. He died here in 1973, aged 91.In accordance with his wishes, his body was taken to Vauvenargues, a 14th century chateau he had bought for Jacqueline in 1958 on the hills outside Aix-en-Provence. He was buried in the grounds, his resting place marked by one of his sculptures. After Jacqueline committed suicide in 1986, she was buried next to him.Last year, for the first time, the public were allowed to view the house which had remained virtually untouched since his death. It is open again this summer until October 2 for visitors who pre-book.Ninety years after his first visit, Picasso is still drawing people to the south of France.GETTING THEREINSPIRATION: A 1957 Picasso of the Cote d'AzurAer Lingus - aerlingus.com - flies to Nice from Dublin and Cork.

The painter and his muse had a secret affair for over eight years before Walter got pregnant and the affair was discovered by Picasso's wife, Olga. At the time, Picasso was also having an affair with Dora Maar. The artist suggested that both his muses fight it out for his affections. Walter continued to be involved with Picasso till the early 1940s.Gala, born in Russia, was first married to poet Paul √âluard. The two had an open marriage and √âluard would introduce Gala to new artists, including Max Ernst, who became one of her lovers. Gala met Salvador Dali in 1929 and soon after, they began to live together. Almost immediately after they met, Dali began featuring Gala in his paintings. She became his muse, portrait model and business manager. He even signed his paintings with both of their names. The two tied the knot in 1934, but Gala continued to have affairs. Her death in 1982 reportedly took a terrible toll on the artist.Bacon's relationship with Dyer was fraught with conflict and had a tragic end. Their relationship began in late 1963 in a pub in Soho and was infused with passion, alcohol and drugs. From then, Dyer became Bacon's muse. However, their relationship started to go downhill, and Dyer's addiction worsened with time. Two days before the opening of the Francis Bacon Retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1971, Dyer committed suicide. Bacon painted the renowned three 'Black Triptychs', which portrayed a few moments before and after Dyer's suicide.Siddal was the muse and model for many pre-Raphaelites before sitting for Rossetti in 1851. Within two years, Siddal and Rossetti began to work with each other exclusively. By 1853, the couple lived together and reportedly became absorbed in each other to the point of becoming anti-social. Some reports suggest that Siddal was plagued by insecurities that she would be replaced by a younger muse and Rossetti worried about his family's approval. The two married in 1860. Siddal died of an overdose of laudanum two years later.Claudel was a French sculptor who started to work as the assistant of renowned sculptor Auguste Rodin. Rodin was drawn to her and soon, she was his lover and muse. What followed was a tumultuous 10-year relationship. Rodin, already in a committed relationship, was not prepared to leave his long-term partner. The destructive aftermath of the affair turned Claudel into a paranoid recluse. She threw away most her of work and spent the last 30 years of her life confined to a mental institution.Word count: 442Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

He re-created Picasso?s painting as part of an assignment for his upper-level Spanish class.Bouvet?s reproduction, and those of other students, hung inside the school?s library Wednesday as part of a one-day art museum meant to enhance the culture, traditions and art of Mexico, Spain and Latin America.Works of artists such as Anita Munman, Dania Sierra and Diego Velazquez were both researched and re-created by students, many of whom showed their own artistic flair using oils, acrylics or charcoal.Spanish teacher Sharon Konish said the project, which she said is in either its eighth or ninth year, helps cultivate artistic talents that many students didn?t know they possessed.It?s also an ongoing tradition that targets not only Spanish students, but those in history, special education and science because teachers will often send them to the museum as part of an assignment, Konish said.?It?s reinforcing research (that students did) of the culture of the language,? she said.For his piece, 17-year-old junior Cody Holland chose ?The Open Window,? by Juan Gris.He spent many hours tracing, sketching and refining his reproduction of the Spanish cubist painter and sculptor?s work, finishing his work a week before the actual deadline.Holland said he specifically picked Gris? work because of its appeal.?You look outside an open window and everything is so free,? Holland said.In researching the artist, he was able to understand more about his specific style of art and the mind-set behind his works.For others, like Bouvet, the reproductions of fellow classmates became a history lesson.In one painting, ?Guernica,? Picasso used abstract images of a mother holding her dead child, a dying horse and a fatally wounded soldier clutching a broken sword, to capture the gruesome reality and agony of war.?Different artists were drawing things they had done in their lives. Picasso drew pictures of war in a negative way,?Bouvet said.If Picasso were alive today, Bouvet believes, he would create similar anti-war paintings to depict what?s happening in Iraq.CREDIT: Word count: 397Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

This fall, the Museum of Modern Art plans to showcase a less-celebrated aspect of Picasso's output--his sculpture--with a major survey of three-dimensional works that spans the artist's entire career. Featuring around 150 pieces from major collections around the world, ""Picasso Sculpture"" will run from Sept. 14, 2015 to Feb. 7, 2016. The show will occupy the entire fourth floor of MoMA's galleries, the museum announced on Thursday, and includes a number of sculptures that will be on view in the U.S. for the first time. It is the largest U.S. exhibition of Picasso's sculptures since MoMA mounted ""The Sculpture of Picasso"" in 1967, according to the museum. The exhibition follows recent high-profile Picasso shows at Pace Gallery and Gagosian Gallery, and comes as the value of Picasso's sculptures has been on the rise. Some 50 sculptures were borrowed from Paris's Picasso Museum. The exhibit will also include pieces lent from other major museums and some from MoMA's collection. A self-taught sculptor, Picasso worked in materials ranging from bronze and sheet-metal to plaster and plywood. ""She-Goat,"" a life-size work from 1950, was assembled from plaster and objects found near his studio in the French town of Vallauris and later cast into bronze. A wicker basket, for example, forms the goat's rib cage, while two ceramic jugs were fashioned into udders. Many pieces remained in his possession until his death. The MoMA exhibition will be divided into chapters covering the various periods when Picasso focused on sculpture, and will also include some works on paper and photographs of his three-dimensional works. Diana Widmaier-Picasso, the artist's granddaughter, has been working with MoMA curators Ann Temkin and Anne Umland, on the catalog and to coordinate loans for the show.

The great master himself, Pablo Picasso, would be attending the opening of the yearly ceramics exhibition in the nearby hilltop village of Vallauris, known for its pottery.Armed with his Rolleiflex camera, 31-year-old Quinn jumped into his car and arrived on the scene to shoot a series of images that captured the artist in all his spontaneity. Little did it occur to Quinn (a cabaret singer, musician and self-taught emerging freelance photographer) that this brief encounter with Picasso would lead to a close friendship between the two men lasting 19 years, right up to the end of the artist's life.Quinn had an eminently likeable quality that inspired trust. Tall, thin, and handsome, with a dapper little moustache and shy, friendly smile, the Dublin-born photographer hardly fit the intrusive image of a celebrity-chasing paparazzo. As he would later recount in his book The Private Picasso, the real secret was knowing how to keep out of Picasso's way. ""This one doesn't disturb me,"" Quinn heard the artist tell a friend.Along with discretion, Quinn's keen eye and superb black-and-white portraits prompted Picasso to invite him into his world, both inside the studio and at home with friends and family.Now the fruits of that friendship have gone on display at the Musee Picasso in the south of France. Housed in the 12th-century stone Chateau Grimaldi in Antibes, 'Picasso Sans Cliche, Photography by Edward Quinn', has 126 images that span from the 1950s to 1972, a year before the artist's death.The pictures offer privileged glimpses into Picasso's persona, capturing fleeting meditative moments when the artist is absorbed in creation. Highlights include a close-up of the 70-year-old artist at the 1951 Vallauris ceramic exhibition, brows furrowed in thought, smoking a cigarette as he gazes intently at something outside of the frame. Another shows the artist kneading a small bird clay sculpture at the Madoura atelier, where Picasso discovered his newly-found passion.Quinn also captures the excitement of summertime bullfights held in Vallauris -- in the grandstands, we witness a complicitous moment between Jean Cocteau, Picasso and his future wife, Jacqueline, applauding with radiant smiles; and there is the artist, bare-chested, in an open woven shirt and sombrero-style hat, flanked by his two young children, Claude and Paloma, eyes riveted on the arena.Over the years, Quinn shot more than 9,000 photos of the artist and was a regular visitor to Picasso's villa, La Californie in Cannes, and Notre Dame Vie in Mougins. ""In Quinn's photos, you can really feel Picasso's presence in the studio, even in his absence,"" Jean-Louis Andral, the exhibition curator, tells me. ""Since Picasso pretty much lived where he worked, there was no real separation.""Indeed, the empty studio shots -- a joyous jumble of sculptures, paintings, drawings and tables overflowing with paints, newspapers, books and rolled canvases -- offer compelling portraits of the artist.""What I also find very touching is how Quinn was able to capture the tenderness between Picasso and Jacqueline,"" Andral says. ""You can really get a sense of their passion, despite the 43-year age difference.""Predictably, Quinn's reputation as Picasso's photographer made it easier to approach other painters on the Cote D'Azur, including Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Francis Bacon and David Hockney.The son of a Guinness brewery worker and educated in Dublin, Edward Quinn earned certificate in metal-plate work, only to decide he'd rather play guitar and double bass a band in Belfast. After World War II, he switched jobs to became a radio navigator for Chartair, an airline based in Tangier, and he took his first pictures with a simple folding Kodak camera. In 1948, Quinn met his future wife, Zurich-born Gret Sulser, on a flight to Marseille. Before long, they were married in Monaco, where she had settled.Working as a Latino-style crooner in Riviera nightclubs (under the name of 'Eddie Quinero'), Quinn eventually got his hands on professional camera and began shooting bathing beauties on the beach, hoping to find something more newsworthy to sell to magazines. In 1950, after learning an Irish horse had won a jumping contest in Nice, he packed up his gear and photographed the triumphant horseman, Captain Turbidy. The Irish Independent published the photo, Quinn's first. ""At that moment,"" Quinn later recalled, ""I began to take my work as a photographer seriously... and transformed the tiny kitchen of a kindly Monegasque friend into a darkroom.""In the 1950s and 1960s, when the Cote d'Azur was a millionaire's playground, teeming with celebrities, film stars and crown heads of Europe, Quinn's easy charm would serve him well. He started working for Paris-Match and other agencies, and photographed the likes of Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier III (immortalising their first shy handshake), Brigitte Bardot, Liz Taylor and Marlon Brando, among others.""He had a knack for getting close to stars and became good friends with people like Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak,"" says Quinn's nephew, Wolfgang Frei, a Swiss TV journalist who often accompanied his uncle as an assistant (""I basically drove him around when was in my twenties"").""In those years, there were no agents or PR people so the contact was direct. Quinn knew all the concierges at the Carlton and the Majestic in Cannes. He also had connections at the airline companies for tip-offs on stars arriving at the Nice airport.""Among his uncle's favourite anecdotes was Quinn's account of meeting Audrey Hepburn back in 1951 when the still unknown actress was shooting a film called Monte Carlo Baby.""He spotted something special about Hepburn right away and suggested a photo session in the perched medieval village of Eze, about 30 minutes away. So, they climbed into Quinn's little Belgian car, which was quite old, and chugged up the steep hill. On the way there, the car broke down, so he had to ask Audrey to get out and push it."""" Today, Frei and his wife Ursula manage the Edward Quinn archive and continue to publish stunning posthumous books (Riviera Cocktail [2007], Stars and Cars of the 50s2008], Celebrity Pets [2014]) from a bygone era. ""We have something like 180,000 negatives in the archives and only 30,000 have been scanned,"" says Frei.Their next project is organising an exhibition based on Quinn's book, James Joyce's Dublin [1974], a compilation of street scenes matched with selected quotes of Joyce's works. ""Quinn is known as a Riviera celebrity photographer, but he was also interested in shooting street children, bars, the races and the poor,"" Frei says. ""He would have really liked to do a show in Dublin -- Ireland always remained very important to him.""Picasso Sans Cliche: Photographies d'Edward Quinn takes place at the Musee Picasso in Antibes until July 2Word count: 1139Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But Sabartes was alerting Gilot that, as she put it in her memoirs, the studio was 'the temple of a kind of Picasso religion'. Gilot was in her early thirties when she left Picasso.

Yet he hated the idea that art historians and biographers might confine the scope of his work or his character within an article or a book. Born in Malaga in 1881, the artist grew up to become a shape-shifter. He worked in many different styles, to avoid becoming mannered, and would periodically change his friends, his entourage, his homes, his pets and, of course, his lovers. As his old friend and secretary, the Spanish poet Jaime Sabartes, once said, 'That's his strength! The key to his youth. Like a moulting snake, he leaves his old skin behind him and begins a new existence elsewhere.' Nearly four decades after his death in 1973, he remains a surprisingly slippery figure. According to his biographer, John Richardson, Picasso was so paradoxical that almost any statement made about him tends to be no less true in reverse. How can we be sure of anything about such a mercurial man? This question has preoccupied me while writing and presenting Modern Masters, a new four-part television series about modern art, which will be broadcast on BBC One next month. Each programme is devoted to a different figure that dominated the art of the 20th century. Inevitably, one of the artists is Picasso (Matisse, Dali and Warhol are the other three). To try to understand the nature of Picasso's genius, I met several women who featured prominently in his life, and inspired him to make art. Women were extraordinarily important for Picasso, who was by turns kind and cruel to all his wives, muses and mistresses. According to the French painter Francoise Gilot, who was his mistress for a decade after they met in 1943, Picasso was fond of saying, 'For me, there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats.' Yet even the 'doormats' (and there are many instances of the artist psychologically trampling over his nearest and dearest) played an important role in the evolution of his art: after all, one of the cardinal myths about Picasso is that his work changed direction whenever a new woman became the principal lover in his life. As he once said: 'When I love a woman, that tears everything apart - especially my painting.' As a result, certain women are associated with different periods of his career. His first significant lover, Fernande Olivier, a model with copious reddish hair, is the roseate goddess who dominated Picasso's output during the first decade of the 20th century. Olga Koklova, a dancer with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes who became Picasso's first wife in 1918, presided over what one of Picasso's poet friends satirically called his 'duchess period', when he fraternised with the rich and famous and produced neoclassical work. The blond Marie-Therese Walter, with whom Picasso began a passionate affair in the mid-1920s, inspired a run of sumptuously erotic canvases, full of squidgy, pliant female flesh. Dora Maar, the Surrealist photographer who became Picasso's companion in the 1930s, will forever be remembered as the 'Weeping Woman', immortalised in the famous painting of that name in the Tate. Few of these women met happy ends: as one mistress put it, 'Picasso was a sun all on his own. He lit up, burned, consumed and reduced to ashes anyone who approached him.' Fernande was impoverished for most of her life, while her former lover amassed inordinate wealth. Olga and Dora both suffered mental-health problems. Marie- Therese and Picasso's second wife, Jacqueline Roque, both committed suicide. Yet three women, all of whom were intimately involved with the artist during the 1950s, survived the experience of flying close to the sun that was Picasso. While filming Modern Masters, I met them all: Francoise Gilot, Genevieve Laporte and Sylvette David. In different ways, their memories illuminate Picasso, both as a man and as an artist. By the early 1950s, Picasso's life was disintegrating. For part of each year he was based in the southern French town of Vallauris, where he had been making innovative ceramics at the Madoura pottery since 1947. But he was no longer considered to be in the vanguard of modern art, and the market for his work had become sluggish. The response to an exhibition of almost 150 ceramics in Paris in 1948, for instance, had been indifferent ('They expect to be shocked and terrorised,' Picasso said. 'If the monster only smiles, then they're disappointed'). Moreover, his relationship with Gilot, who had given him two children, was collapsing. In part, this was thanks to Picasso's affair with Genevieve Laporte, a pretty poet whom he had met as a schoolgirl in Paris soon after the liberation. In September 1953 Gilot took the children, bought a one-way train ticket to Paris, and walked out on Picasso - a display of independence that distressed his male ego. That winter he made a series of drawings, which the French Surrealist writer Michel Leiris described as 'the pictorial journal of a detestable season in hell'. The following spring, searching for a new lease of life, Picasso began a series of about 40 paintings, drawings and sculptures inspired (unusually for him, since he ordinarily worked from memory) by a real-life model called Sylvette David. Picasso had spotted Sylvette, a gorgeous 19- year-old who wore her hair in a dishevelled blond ponytail, in Vallauris, where she was living with her English boyfriend, Toby Jellinek, a sculptor and furniture designer. Sylvette never became Picasso's mistress, and their friendship faded in the summer of 1954. By the end of the year, Jacqueline Roque, a 27-year-old divorcee who had worked in the Madoura pottery's saleroom, had replaced Gilot. Picasso married Jacqueline in 1961, seven months short of his 80th birthday. Today Gilot, 88, lives in an apartment in Manhattan decorated with many of her own colourful canvases, as well as a painting by Georges Braque, with whom Picasso pioneered Cubism. When we meet, her wide face looks melancholic. Her lips often droop at either end, creating the impression of an inverted smile. I am reminded of the curse that Picasso laid on her when she broke the news that she was leaving him, as recorded in Life with Picasso, her vivid memoirs that chronicled many intimate details about the artist . 'Even if you think people like you, it will only be a kind of curiosity they will have about a person whose life has touched mine so intimately,' Picasso told her. 'For you, reality is finished... you're headed straight for the desert.' The artist was outraged when Life with Picasso was published in 1964 because it presented him at times as childish, egotistical and a misogynist (at one point Gilot suggests that he had 'a kind of Bluebeard complex that made him want to cut off the heads of all the women he had collected in his little private museum'). He tried unsuccessfully to prevent the publication of the book in France. The stress exacerbated his stomach ulcers, and in 1965 he travelled to Paris to undergo an operation that left him unable to paint for 18 months. Picasso later avenged himself on Gilot by banishing their children, Claude and Paloma, from his sight. Gilot first visited Picasso's studios at 7 rue des Grands-Augustins on the Left Bank of Paris shortly after they had met in a restaurant in May 1943, during the German occupation. On the floor, next to Picasso's celebrated sculpture The Man with the Sheep, stood a still life of oranges, painted by Matisse in Morocco in 1912. 'Picasso's secretary, Sabartes, was there,' Gilot tells me. 'As we were going up the stairs, I gasped and said, ""Oh, what a fantastic Matisse."" And Sabartes said, ""No. Here there is only Picasso.""' Picasso greatly admired Matisse's luminous Basket of Oranges, which he had acquired from a dealer in exchange for one of his own early paintings in 1942. But Sabartes was alerting Gilot that, as she put it in her memoirs, the studio was 'the temple of a kind of Picasso religion'. After the Second World War, Picasso resumed his tense friendship with Matisse. In February 1946 Picasso took Gilot to meet the French artist, who by this time was a semi-invalid (he had almost died from complications following an operation for duodenal cancer in 1941). But despite being increasingly bedridden, Matisse was still able to paint and create colourful paper cutouts. 'When we arrived, Picasso introduced me to Matisse, and Matisse answered right away that he would be pleased to make my portrait,' Gilot recalls. 'That shocked Picasso, because Picasso had not made any portrait of me as yet. And Matisse added, ""Yes, I would make her skin a pale blue, and her reddish hair would have to be green."" That was amusing: they liked to provoke each other a little bit. It was a competition as well as a friendship.' The meeting stimulated Picasso to use a palette of greens and cool blues to make The Woman-Flower, his quintessential portrait of Gilot, later that year. Does Gilot feel haunted by Picasso's ghost? 'Absolutely not,' she says immediately, her eyes suddenly combative. 'Otherwise I would have stayed where I was. I didn't stay because I had a right to have my own experiences. You can't live somebody else's life.' Gilot was in her early thirties when she left Picasso. 'Later, I married Jonas Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine,' she says, before attacking her next three words with hissing staccato: 'And so what?' A pause. 'It proves I was up to it. You know, I'm not tame. I had always liked my freedom, and I kept my freedom. That's very important. Otherwise what do you become - the caretaker of a museum?' In her memoirs, Gilot denies that she left Picasso because she no longer wanted to live with a 'historical monument', as had been reported in newspapers at the time. But perhaps that was the case after all. Picasso's mistress Genevieve Laporte, who was embroiled with the artist while he was still living with Gilot, paints a different picture. 'Picasso was just the contrary of what you read,' says Laporte, a former Resistance fighter who became a documentary filmmaker as well as a poet, and in 2005 auctioned off 20 sketches by Picasso that the artist had given to her. 'He was shy, full of tenderness, very delicate.' As we talk over lunch in Paris, Laporte, now in her eighties, shows me reproductions of naturalistic drawings that Picasso made of her, often sleeping and in the nude, in 1951. Seven of the drawings were used to illustrate Les Cavaliers d'ombre, a volume of her poems that appeared in June 1954. 'When he drew me,' she says, 'he would put on his glasses, and his look was that of a man in love - very soft, very tender. Then he changed completely. I was dressed, but I had the feeling that I was naked. He drew like a hurricane. Then, suddenly, it was over. He would take off his glasses, and timidly show me the drawing to find out what I thought. The hurricane was lost.' Laporte and Picasso began their affair in 1951, seven years after they had first met when, as a 17- year-old schoolgirl, she arrived at the rue des Grands-Augustins to interview the artist for her student newspaper in October 1944. During that initial meeting, Laporte infuriated Picasso by suggesting that young people did not understand his painting. 'He became absolutely mad,' she recalls. 'He got up and said, ""Painting is not meant to be understood. My painting is not mathematics. Do you 'understand' the songs of birds? Do you 'understand' pommes de terre?""' When they became lovers, Picasso was 70. 'But his behaviour was very youthful,' Laporte tells me. 'We laughed a lot. He told me, ""Everybody thinks that I am dramatic, but I want to laugh."" He told me that his life with Gilot had become hell. He said to [his friend, the Surrealist poet] Paul Eluard, ""She [Laporte] makes me laugh. She has saved my life.""' She pauses. 'Maybe things would have fallen apart later, I don't know. But Picasso never painted a woman smiling, except me. His portraits of other women are often very hard. I think of his drawings of me as Picasso's tender period.' According to Laporte, their relationship ended soon after Gilot had left Picasso for good. Laporte, who was living in a farmhouse in Arbonne on the edge of the forest of Fontainebleau, less than an hour's drive from Paris, had not seen Picasso for several months (they had kept in touch 'merely' by exchanging letters). But one day she received a telegram from Picasso urgently summoning her to the rue des Grands-Augustins. 'We had lunch together, and then he said, ""Now I can go with you to Fontainebleau,""' Laporte says. 'We left in my car, and he said, ""You can't imagine how much I loved you."" We spent the night together in a hotel in Barbizon. The next day, Picasso asked me to come with him to Vallauris. And I said an awful thing: ""First, change your sheets."" Gilot had only left the previous morning.' Laporte and Picasso did see each other again, but this encounter marked the end of their affair. The months that followed proved difficult for Picasso, who was unaccustomed to living alone. In December 1953 he painted a number of haunting paintings in blacks, whites and greys, including The Shadow, which is often seen as a meditation on loneliness and loss. Then, the following spring, he spotted the lusciously freckled face and slender young body of Sylvette David in Vallauris. 'It was a chance encounter,' recalls David, an ethereal, gentle woman who is an artist in her own right, more indebted to Marc Chagall than Picasso. Today she is called Lydia Corbett (she took a new Christian name when she was baptised, and goes by her married surname), and lives in rural Devon, which is where we meet. In the early 1950s she was fresh out of school, leading a carefree existence with a boyfriend, Toby Jellinek, and her English-born mother, a potter based in Vallauris. In April 1954 she was chatting to friends in a cafe when, on the other side of the wall, Picasso held up an Impressionistic drawing of her that he had done from memory. She had caught his eye. She subsequently visited his studio, and he asked her to model for him. 'He loved my ponytail and my long neck,' Corbett recalls with a dreamy giggle as she sifts through a battered leather trunk that she calls her 'memory suitcase' because it contains black-andwhite photographs of her younger self, as well as clippings about her and Picasso from newspapers and magazines such as Paris Match. 'For several months, I used to visit his studio once or twice a week, and each session would last two or three hours,' she says. 'There was always a mountain of blue Gitanes cigarette packets in the studio.' (One of the paintings, created on May 1 1954, will be included in Tate Liverpool's exhibition Picasso: Peace and Freedom, which opens on May 21.) She pauses. 'He must have been about 73 - my age now - but when he looked at me I felt his youth. I was very serious. I didn't dare open my mouth. So he tried to make me laugh. He showed me a little room with a bed and a window, and he jumped on the bed - he was very agile for a man in his seventies. I think he wanted me to jump with him, like little children do. But I wasn't going to do that. He understood that I didn't want to play games.' On another occasion, Picasso led Sylvette to a barn that housed his ancient Hispano-Suiza car. 'He invited me to sit with him on the big leather seat in the back and he told me lots of stories, about Spain, about his youth, about how he loved to write poetry, how he loved his animals - his monkey, goat and dogs. He talked about the circus [acrobats and harlequins had played a prominent role in Picasso's early paintings]. I think he was going back into his youth. If I had been different, maybe we would have fallen in love, but I had a boyfriend.' Picasso paid Jellinek to assist him in making folded-metal sculptures of Sylvette's head, one of which will be included in Picasso: The Mediterranean Years, a new exhibition opening at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. 'Picasso asked if I would like to be paid for being a model,' Corbett says, 'but I was afraid that if he paid me he would make me pose in the nude. Older men can be really naughty and flirtatious, but Picasso wasn't at all - he was lovely. He was always like a father figure, really: sweet. He immortalised me. I'm like the Mona Lisa. At the time, I felt like I was dancing on clouds.' 'The whole episode came to an end in early June 1954,' says Elizabeth Cowling, professor of art history at the University of Edinburgh, who has written extensively on Picasso. 'It was a natural cycle. Picasso had worked intensively on this group of paintings and sculptures and drawings of Sylvette, and he'd come to the end of it.' Cowling believes that we should think differently about Picasso's women. 'I have no doubt that the women in Picasso's life were a very important inspiration for his work,' she says. 'But you could see it another way, and say instead that Picasso found the right woman to correspond with his aesthetic needs. He was driven by the imperative of his art. So to make everything turn around the women is to my mind a great mistake.' Picasso died at his villa near the village of Mougins in the hills above Cannes in April 1973. He left behind him a vast and varied body of work, consisting of more than 43,000 pieces - the largest recorded output of any artist ever. As the women I met attest, everything he made was relentlessly rooted in his own life. His nature encompassed everything - and so did his art. He presented humanity in all its rawness, and excluded nothing. There is no emotion or sensation, no matter how exalted or how depraved, that Picasso did not express visually in a brilliant and arresting new way. So who was the real Picasso? The unfaithful control freak who tormented Francoise Gilot? The tender, timid lover who seduced Genevieve Laporte? Or the playful, chain-smoking father- figure described by Sylvette David? The answer is that he was all of these and none of these. Picasso's identity was supremely complex. One minute, he could be charming as an angel; the next, he was diabolically foul. The unifying factor was his compulsion to make art. As he said: 'Painting makes me do what it wants.' 'Modern Masters' begins on BBC One next month 'He was like a father figure: sweet. He immortalised me. I'm like the Mona Lisa. At the time, I felt like I was dancing on clouds' 'I kept my freedom,' Gilot says. 'Otherwise, what do you become? The caretaker of a museum?' According to Francoise Gilot, Picasso was fond of saying, 'For me, there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats' 'He showed me a little room with a bed and a window, and he jumped on the bed - he was very agile for a man in his seventies' Credit: Alastair Sooke IllustrationCaption: Above Gilot in 2003, in front of her own oil painting, Night Sky (1999).

His tweed jacket was nice and scratchy. He smelled good, too. He smelled of cologne and French tobacco. But eventually it was time for him to go home to France, where he had four children of his own. The oldest was a boy called Paulo. The next oldest was a girl called Maya. The next next oldest was a boy called Claude (he was the same age as me). The youngest was a little girl called Paloma. One day we all went to the south of France to visit Picasso. He kept a side-table piled high with masks and funny hats. We all had to choose a disguise and wear it for most of the day. Can you see me here? Even Mum used to dress up. She must have liked her new nose because she took this photo of herself in the mirror...

But if I absolutely had to spend that amount of money on art, I think I would go for the Scrovegni Chapel that Giotto painted in Padua, Italy. I'd buy the whole thing. I'd also get a little house near by. The reason I would choose that is because it really is the most charming place. You are simply surrounded by his paintings wherever you are. It's quite a radical approach to looking at a church, you literally walk into the art. There's a whole story that's being told in the pictures in a very cartoon-like way. It's wonderful, I always try to visit when I'm at the Venice Biennale.""Sandy Nairne, Director of the National Portrait Gallery`Equestrian Portrait of Charles I', Sir Anthony van Dyck, c1637""Acquiring the Van Dyck portrait is a fantasy of a very hypothetical kind as it is in fact sitting in the National Gallery. I suppose museum directors are often jealous of artwork in other people's galleries but this painting has become a favourite of mine. In very simple terms it is a five-star sitter by a five-star artist. It demonstrates a great combination of political power and individual personality entwined together on a very grand and overwhelming scale, which is why it is so extraordinary. This is a doomed king who could not expect to survive the difficulties and exigencies of his time. But here, we see him appearing extremely calming despite the obstacles he was facing. It conveys a brilliant sense of calmness.""Sir Christopher Frayling, Chair of the Arts Council and Rector of Royal College of ArtOne of the original 1952 series of the `Screaming Popes', by Francis Bacon""I would spend the money on the artists of tomorrow rather than the artist of yesterday. Picasso was 24 when he painted this picture and the average age of my students at the Royal College is 26. I would set up a fund for grants for young artists to ensure they flourish. I would also create a new gallery complex that opened its doors widely and allowed everyone to enjoy the works of artists alive and dead. The third thing I would do is set up a scheme where I send artists into schools all over the country to inspire and excite young people towards visual arts. With any change I have left over, I would buy one of Francis Bacon's original Screaming Popes, the portraits of Pope Innocent X after Velazquez, and put it up in my office, because it occasionally embodies my state of mind.""Richard Calvocoressi, Director of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art`Self-Portrait with Lowered Head', Egon Schiele, 1912""It is just a small head of the artist looking very tense and drawn and brooding. The figure is very ... muted. It's a very powerful, intense, brooding, neurotic, introspective portrait. It has a death-like quality about it. The skin is ... almost diseased- looking. We borrowed it for an exhibition at the Tate Modern a few years ago. It's really quite small but it makes a big impact. I think it has a power disproportionate to its size. I chose the painting because Schiele is such an important artist for the 20th century for the development of portraiture, body art and performance art but he is completely unrepresented in Britain ... It made such a big impact on postwar art.""Antony Gormley, Artist`The Baptism', Piero della Francesca, 1442 ""I would probably choose Piero's Baptism from the National Gallery.

She has delicious pink skin and she is lying on luxurious sheets with a perfume burner in front of her. The work is a great study in sensuality. The girl in the painting has an air of real expectancy, as if she is expecting her lover any second to jump on top of her. I first saw the painting as a 17-year-old schoolgirl in Paris and I thought, even then as a naive and inexperienced girl, what a sexy picture it was.

He was a man of his era extremely industrious and industriously extreme and like all people who live for a long time, he encountered unexpected turbulence. In his lifetime were two world wars, the Spanish Civil War, Guernica, Korea and Hiroshima. His 91 years also encompassed the death of Queen Victoria, the liberation of Auschwitz and the release of Dark Side Of The Moon, and he made art which was as fractured, frightening, chaotic, kinetic and oddly beautiful as the times.Picasso was not always as adored as he is now. There were periods during his life when he was regarded as a failure. People said Guernica was the last thing he painted which was worth looking at, and in his dotage he was considered by some to have become a sort of King Leer, driven mad by age and sex. Yet, in the 21st century, he is almost beyond criticism. Along with Van Gogh, Monet and Warhol he is an icon whose art attracts crowds to blockbuster shows around the world, who sells for meaninglessly large sums and who, perhaps even more than those other artists, enthralls with his life story just as much as his life's work.He has become a brand: Esso, Tesco, Picasso. His name sells cars and perfume and, along with Shakespeare, Einstein and Mozart, is shorthand for genius. Everyone agrees Picasso was a great artist. To say otherwise is a sort of flat-earth heresy. But no one ever really asks why. What makes him great? What is it he did that deserves a century of acclaim?We will have the chance to judge for ourselves this month when two Picasso exhibitions open in Edinburgh. Picasso On Paper, at the Dean Gallery from July 14, encompasses drawings, pastels and prints made between 1899 when Picasso was 18 and 1971 when he was 90. Picasso: Fired With Passion, at the National Museum of Scotland from Friday, draws on work created from 1947 to 1961 in an attempt to reveal connections between his private life and artistic career. The show will include ceramics, metalwork, painting and lithography, as well as photographs of Picasso by his friend Lee Miller.In order to try to answer the question of what makes Picasso great, I arrange to meet the curators of the Dean and National Museum shows, Patrick Elliott and Rose Watban, as well as Elizabeth Cowling, an expert based at Edinburgh University. All three speak with enthusiasm bordering on awe. Elliott and Cowling often use the present tense as if Picasso is still painting away on the Cte d'Azur, and Elliott in particular seems, at times, like a schoolboy with a crush ""He's just so cool!"" Cowling is the author of Picasso: Style And Meaning, regarded as one of the definitive books on the artist. She talks of Picasso as if she were Ahab and he were the whaleagreatmysterious beast to follow, glimpse but never quite capture. ""I've spent such a long time working on him, "" she says, ""yet when I look at the catalogue raisonne of his work, I'm always dumbfounded and think, 'Oh my God! There's another lot that I've not understood or even thought about'. My book only goes up to 1940 because I knew it would take me another 15 years to finish the rest.I used to long for him to have died earlier. It shocks fellow Picasso scholars when I say, 'Oh, but don't you sometimes wish he had fallen out of an aeroplane when he was 60?'."" Although it frustrates her, Cowling believes one of the things that makes Picasso great is his extraordinary prolificacy. ""The volume of his work is huge. I don't know how many tens of thousands of works he produced. Quality control is not always maintained. There's a lot of second-rate, third-rate stuff. That said, if you were to count up the major works he produced, it still runs into hundreds or thousands.""And it's not just in one medium. As well as painting, he's a key figure in the history of 20th-century sculpture and printmaking. He's a great draughtsman. Even people who hate his work agree on that. He was a key figure in early 20th-century stage design. Some people would argue, based on the surrealist texts and plays, that he's actually a major writer. Also, he reinvents ceramics. So you've got this vast quantity of work in different media, and those media have been revolutionised by what he's done. You never come to the end of his work. You can always find something else."" For Elliott, Picasso's genius is even more straightforward. ""He was the greatest artist of the 20th century, or for me the greatest artist full stop. He just couldn't stop being inventive and imaginative.The most imaginative artist of all time.""Toprove his point, he shows me Minotauromachie, an etching from 1935 which is one of the key works in the Dean show. ""This is probably the greatest print of the 20th century, "" he says, shaking his head.""Picasso made it in less than a day."" Pablo Picasso was born in Malaga on October 25, 1881. His father, Jose Ruiz Blasco, was a painter with a penchant for pigeons who realised early on that his son was extremely talented. Picasso received his first formal art lessons when he was 10 and before his teens was producing impressive drawings based on antique sculpture. In 1895, he enrolled at art school in Barcelona.""As a teenage boy, poor little lad, he was propelled into painting really big canvases which won local prizes, "" says Cowling. ""His first exhibition in Paris in 1901, when he was completely unknown in France, was extremely hyped. When he was only 20, people started calling him Le Petit Goya the little Goya. So that was the aura around him and he clearly did fascinate people. Not only women, but a lot of his peers.People say that when he was a student alongside them, and usually quite a few years younger than they were, he was more advanced in every way.They knew he was the coming man."" Picasso's early paintings were realistic works, not the sort of thing we now visualise when his name is mentioned. In 1900, he visited Paris for the first time, painting the gloom and glitter of the demi-monde.The following year, he entered what has come to be known as his Blue Period. One of the major paintings to come out of this phase was The Frugal Meal which, in 1904, he made into an etching. ""That's only the second print he ever made, "" says Patrick Elliott, pointing to a reproduction in the catalogue for Picasso On Paper. ""He was 22 and had never studied how to make a print, but a friend gave him an old metal plate to use, and he was immediately good and instinctive. The Frugal Meal is typical of this period when he was obsessed with poverty, prostitution and blindness. He was fond of brothels at the time and very poor. He was literally burning drawings at night to stay warm."" Picasso rented a studio in the Bateau-Lavoir, a run- down building in Montmartre, and began work on the Hen Broon harlequins and similarly lanky acrobats of his Rose Period. In 1907 influenced by antique sculpture he saw in the Louvre and African and Oceanic art he saw in the Musee d'Ethnographie du Trocadero he began work on the painting that marks the point when people stopped thinking of him as a young man of great promise and began to regard him as an unassailable genius. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon bears roughly the same relation to the development of painting as splitting the atom does to physics it changed things and opened up a world of possibilities.With its range of contrasting styles, the painting is emblematic of all Picasso's work, and its jagged geometry can be regarded as pointing towards Cubism, the fractured, semi-abstract style that Picasso together with his friend Georges Braque would invent and develop.""Cubism is a completely different way of viewing the world, "" says Elliott. ""It comes about partly because a photograph can look more like a human than Picasso can ever paint, and everyone by 1910 has got a box Brownie, so trying to make things look real is no longer the artist's main preoccupation. Also, the world's changing at an amazing rate you've got the telephone coming in, radio, cars, trains and art's got to change too. So Picasso began painting things from different angles all at once.It's as if you're rotating around the figure and everything's speeded up.""He started using collage, too. Again, a completely new way of looking at the world. Instead of painting something trying to copy it with a pencil or a brush why not just take the thing and stick it on the canvas?This is a complete revelation, a new relationship between reality and representation. Cubism and collage are the biggest moves in art since the invention of perspective around 1500."" Another important aspect of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, a quality it shares with much of Picasso's output, is that it provokes sensations in anyone who sees it. It is thought to be set in a brothel, and a man moving his eyes from left to right across its eight-foot square surface may well feel a degree of sexual arousal followed by detumescent horror; that crouching figure on the bottom on right, all angry snout and hunkers, is like something from The Exorcist her head appears to be slowly spinning round. Emmanuelle it isn't.""It's very important that his work is not just a stylistic game, it's intensely emotional, "" says Elizabeth Cowling. ""You may not like what you see, but he stirs you up. He does engage with human feelings. And they are quite violent, these pictures. They are very often extremely ugly.They are often outrageous and shocking, and actually that's important.""As Picasso himself said, art is not just for decoration of apartments. It should keep you alert and make you think. He can be very tragic as an artist, but also extremely funny. He's very good at storytelling and there's a lot of drama and interaction in his work. This is why he didn't like completely abstract art. The removal of human emotion, which happened in a lot of abstract art, didn't happen in his work."" This emotionalism, and the related fact so much of his work had people in it, is probably one of the reasons Picasso has remained so popular. It's art to make the heart beat harder. You can't really say that about true abstract artists like Mondrian or Jackson Pollock. Galleries ought to dish out defibrillators at shows of their paintings.Patrick Elliott shows me a pieces which exemplify Picasso's nervejangling approach. The first is a 1934 ink drawing called The Death Of Marat. Ostensibly a homage to Louis David's 1793 painting of the French revolutionary writer murdered in his bath, Picasso's drawing is thought to represent his first wife Olga Khokhlova, who wouldn't accept a divorce, stabbing his pregnant lover Marie-Therse Walter. ""It's amazing, "" says Elliott, ""the way he can do that screaming head a sort of blob with little strokes for teeth which stands more than any realistic work for absolute anguish and horror and venom. You can't even see her body. It's just a raging mouth. That's what Picasso can do reduce a figure to a mouth."" Elliott then turns to Weeping Woman I, an etching from 1937 based on drawings Picasso made in preparation for his iconic painting Guernica.""This is one of the great prints of the 20th century, "" he says. ""Both eyes are on the same side of the head, the nose is some kind of bulbous banana, but emotionally it works, with these knitting needle things stabbing in, and the handkerchief repitched as a sort of shard of glass. It's one of the great images of pain and passion in art. Fantastic thing. I think that's something anyone can love."" The face of the Weeping Woman is based on Dora Maar.The French woman was a lover of Picasso and documented his painting of Guernica. ""All his work has an autobiographical edge, "" says Elliott, ""and if you can pin events in someone's life on to the work, or read it through the human personality, it becomes more digestible. For example, he had seven or eight mistresses in his life, and you can structure his entire oeuvre according to different mistresses."" Elliott points to a 1926 drawing of a woman with bobbed hair and says something remarkable. ""This was always taken to be a picture of MarieTherse, his girlfriend. It looks just like her. But in fact there is proof that it was made six months before he met her. So he was making these pictures of this invented woman and then in 1927 sees, outside Paris's equivalent of Jenners, someone who looks just like them. So he goes up to Marie-Therse and asks her out. She was 17. He seemed to be attracted to women who resembled those he had imagined and painted.The same thing happened with Francoise Gilot and Jacqueline Roque."" Picasso married twice and had four children by three different women.Marie-Therse Walter bore him a daughter, Maya, though they never married. She hung herself four years after his death. ""He's had a bad press from feminists for racing through all these girlfriends, "" says Elliott.""It was just like styles. He'd go through styles, go through men and women, wring them out emotionally, absorb it and leave them dry. Many people just couldn't recover from it. Amazing to know him but, once he'd sucked you dry and spat you out and moved on to the next style or woman or printer or friend, you were in a pretty parlous state."" He seems to have been an unstoppable force of nature, a kind of comet using whoever came into his orbit as fuel and then leaving them burned out in his wake. ""Even in photographs of Picasso in his shorts and slippers, he has this energy that I think almost comes out of the picture at you, "" says Rose Watban of the National Museum of Scotland.""So meeting him must have been unbelievable.""Watban's show Picasso: Fired With Passion concentrates on a relatively domesticated period of his life. In 1944, he had begun seeing a young art student, Francoise Gilot, and they had two children together, Claude and Paloma. Following the war, which he had spent in Nazi-occupied Paris, Picasso began holidaying in the south of France, where the culture and climate reminded him of his native Catalonia.In 1946, he visited Vallauris, a town famous for its pottery since the Roman era. Picasso was attracted to the ceramics being made by the Madoura Pottery and in 1947 began to work there, at first simply painting on to existing plates and vases, then later adapting unfired pieces, transforming a jug into a female form, a bottle into an insect and so on. Just as he had done with printmaking, Picasso quickly introduced technical innovations that astounded people who had spent their lives working with ceramics. He produced more than 2000 pieces in the first year. Apparently, Madoura could hardly keep up with him.""Until after Picasso was dead, in a lot of quarters his ceramics were regarded as a bit of a joke, "" says Watban. ""The paintings of the period are looked upon as very interesting and great work. In Vallauris, he painted Massacre In Korea. He also painted War And Peace. So there were these political things coming out and at the same time he was painting these funny wee faces on to ceramics. But what Picasso did was lift ceramics up from an artisanal craft into something that could be looked at as art."" It would be foolish to sneer at Picasso's ceramics. If they are the product of personal happiness and encapsulate his joie de vivre then, surely, they are as significant in their own way as the major paintings?Picasso painted Guernica because he hated death, and the reason he hated death is because he loved life. The joy of the ceramics comes, ultimately, from the same place as the horror of the paintings the mind and soul of an artist in love with creation.So what, then, is so great about Pablo Picasso? Perhaps one reason that question is so rarely asked is that it is so difficult to answer.Certainly, he was hugely influential and prolific, a virtuoso able to leap between media and styles as easily as one of his acrobats. We must also acknowledge the sheer force of his personality has kept him high in our estimation and made him the ideal artist for our celebrity age.Ultimately, though, Picasso's greatness is mysterious; we sense it but cannot explain it simply by deconstructing the elements of his work, just as transcribing the score of Don Giovanni will not explain the power of its overture. Picasso himself was always loath to analyse his painting, which some regard as a cunning tactic to keep the public interested.Perhaps the reason was deeper and simpler than that he couldn't.""What's interesting to me about his work is that I can't explain it, "" says Patrick Elliott. ""It's difficult to put your finger on why it's so good. I remember going to a lecture by John Golding, a world expert on Picasso, who said the more he studied his work, the less he understood it. He also said he felt Picasso didn't really know what he was doing.""I think it's totally true that he just got on with things without thinking too much about them. If you read some of the books on him, all the meaning they invest in his work and the rhetoric that goes along with that is just a load of crap. Picasso was simply a magical visual artist with an amazing ability to invent."" Picasso: Fired With Passion is at the National Museum of Scotland, Chambers Street, Edinburgh, July 6-October 28.

The chosen victims were his loved ones. ""No one in my family managed to escape his stranglehold. He needed blood to sign each of his paintings.""It sounds like hyperbole but the death toll suggests a terrible family malediction. Marina's brother Pablito committed suicide by drinking bleach. Her grandmother, the once beautiful Olga, died paralysed. Her father Paolo expired as a broken reed. Jacqueline, Picasso's last wife, shot herself. Marie-Therese Walter, the artist's muse, hanged herself.Marina has no doubt that she, too, was an intended victim. ""In order to create, he had to destroy everything that got in the way of his creation. However, like him, I have enormous energy and a strong character, otherwise I would be dead, too.""She did not escape unscathed, however, spending 14 years in psychoanalysis, marked by uncontrollable tears, fainting fits and screams. ""I have been trying all my life to escape the misery created by Picasso,"" she declares.She has also fallen out with the artist's other heirs, accusing them of greed and ""bad taste"" in selling the family name to Citroen for its people carrier. They look askance at her for adopting three Vietnamese children and diluting the legacy of her two children, products of a failed relationship.Now an elegant, composed and incalculably rich woman of 50, she divides her time between Geneva and Picasso's huge white house in Cannes, which she once associated with unhappy memories. She also runs a foundation for orphaned children in Vietnam and lends her grandfather's pictures to galleries around the world.She was 22 years old when Picasso died in 1973. Believing that all the family's misfortunes flowed from art, she announced she did not want to inherit anything. Persuaded by French lawyers this was impossible, she accepted a quarter of the inheritance, but stacked the paintings against walls so she could not see them.Her grandfather had reached beyond the grave to cause her brother's death, she believed. Six days after Picasso died, Pablito drank a bottle of bleach.""We both loved my grandfather, although it was never reciprocated. When he died my brother and I wanted to see him one last time, but Jacqueline didn't want to receive us. Pablito went to the house alone and they set the dogs on him. He came home and committed suicide.""She found him lying on a sofa, blood bubbling from his mouth, and spent the next three months by his side in hospital until he died. She did not have enough money to pay for his coffin because she and her brother were kept in dependent penury. Pablito had told her it was his attempt to escape; few others had succeeded.In a remarkable new book, Picasso, My Grandfather, to be published Nov. 8 by Chatto & Windus, Marina describes how each member of the family became dependent on and cravenly submissive to Picasso's towering ego.""The Picasso virus to which we fell victim was subtle and undetectable,"" she says. ""It was a combination of promises not kept, abuse of power, mortification, contempt and, above all, incommunicability.""But, it is pointed out to her, many families have a monster and relatives learn to keep their distance. ""No one dared to,"" she replies. Besides, they were connected by a financial blood-drip that kept them in poverty.Every Thursday was ""allowance day."" Marina and Pablito would be led by their father to the big white house to collect their weekly pittance. More often than not, an elderly Italian retainer would inform them: ""The maitre can't see you today. Madame Jacqueline has asked me to tell you that he's working."" The dismissals varied: ""The maitre is sleeping,"" ""the maitre is not here."" Jacqueline's phrase was memorable: ""The sun does not want to be disturbed.""Once admitted, the supplicants were tortured by the spectacle of a pet goat, leaving its droppings amid canvases piled willy-nilly amid a jumble of priceless sculptures and bric-a-brac. The great man was wont to receive them at his studio in his underpants -- ""his overflowing attributes visible"" -- in an uncaring display of his omnipotence that he continued until the end of his life.""The only mark of love I can remember ever receiving from him was a stuffed fig and date,"" Marina confesses. Later she learned that such sweetmeats were called ""mendiants"" -- beggars. Like everyone else, she loved him or, more correctly, she was in awe of the myth he spun around himself.On a good day, her father's subservience would be rewarded with a wad of notes and Picasso's cutting observation that his only son was second rate and a waste of his time. Humiliatingly, her father Paolo's job was as Pablo's chauffeur and labourer. Once he had dreamt of freeing himself by becoming a professional motorbike racer, which Picasso promptly ruled to be too dangerous.""After that, he didn't attempt to have any financial independence. Even when my grandmother Olga died, he didn't accept the Picasso works she left him because he wanted to do nothing to upset his father.""As a boy, Paolo's features had been immortalized in Picasso's works. But one day the pampering ceased, paralysing the young man's will. ""He also painted Olga in their first years together. But when he had used up someone, he went on to another subject.""Marina's mother Emilienne was more in love with the Picasso name than Paolo and the couple separated when Marina was six months old. Too grand to work, Emilienne was reliant on her share of the allowance; a source of loud reproach that distressed the children. Sharing her husband's predilection for drink, she also took to picking up boys on the beach and bringing them home.""I can still remember how humiliated I was as a young teenager when she would walk into a meeting of students and parents dressed in a miniskirt, with a young man barely older than I was.""At 14 years old, Marina put her foot down. Resentful of the way they were being manipulated as pawns in a weekly financial transaction, she and Pablito tried to establish a more personal relationship with their grandfather. ""We wanted to have our own identity but it was badly received. We were beaten. I don't think my grandfather was really interested,"" she says.

"A WRITER AT LARGE: Lunch with Pablo, dinner with Henri ; In 1946 RAYMOND MASON, a young English sculptor, packed his bags and moved to Paris, then the undisputed artistic capital of the world. In this extract from his memoir of half a century as part of the city's competitive cameraderie, he recalls his friendships with two of the 20th century's greatest artists, Pablo Picasso and Henri Cartier-Bresson: [FOREIGN Edition]",The Independent on Sunday,04 May 2003,"AbstractTranslateUndo Translation Learn more about TranslateFromSelect language...ArabicChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CzechDanishEnglishFinnishFrenchGerman HebrewIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanPolishPortugueseRussianSpanishSwedishTurkishTo TranslateTranslation in progress... [[missing key: loadingAnimation]]The full text may take 40-120 seconds to translate; larger documents may take longer.CancelOverlayEndOur conversation continued gaily, then in came some Spanish dancers touring the coast, friends, of course, of [Pablo Picasso]. Before long, the woman in the company, a beauty, had climbed on to the table and broken into a wild dance. The noise was deafening, and I was just saying to myself how marvellous it was to have lunched with Picasso and too bad about the photos, when all of a sudden he clapped his hands and called for silence, saying: ""Yes, but that's not all. We have here a young artist who has come to show us his work."" It was a little glimpse of Picasso's cruel side. All my fellow artists' eyes were now focused unkindly on me, as I laid out the few works I had accomplished to date. There were busts of children, done to make money, that Picasso passed over in silence, a few reliefs and, finally, Barcelona Tram, my first, recently completed high relief. It is one of my good works, one on which I can be judged, and Picasso's enthusiasm was immediate. (It's only lately that I have understood Picasso's emotional fixation on that city. Moreover, the scene depicted in my relief was the facade of the Estacin di Francia, the station from which Picasso had set out more than once for Paris.)Picasso continued to sing my praises, before adding: ""You're an English artist."" I deflated at once, but Picasso, seeing my disappointment, hastened to reassure me that he was very fond of English art, and without a moment's hesitation or a single omission rattled off in chronological order all the important English artists from Hogarth down to the turn of the 20th century. ""But nowadays there's no English art any more. It's become cosmopolitan"" - a word he was fond of - ""like that sculptor, what's his name? You know the one."" I didn't dare breathe. ""M-M-Moo-Moo,"" he went on, tapping me on the chest. ""Moore,"" I timidly suggested. ""That's it, Moore. He's the same thing."" I could hardly believe it. Moore, who had had the honour of seeing Picasso painting Guernica, being talked about in this way. I should add that in 1954 there was little chance of Picasso knowing much, or even anything at all, about Francis Bacon. By way of conclusion, Picasso told me to go and see Kahnweiler in Paris and to tell him he had sent me, a spectacular recommendation. Only on the road back, still glowing with pleasure from my afternoon with Picasso, did I remember that I hadn't asked him a thing about the potters in Vallauris![Henri Cartier-Bresson] is essentially an artist. He has lived all his life in Paris, a city of art and artists. The Louvre is right outside his door, and you can still see him there today, sitting on his shooting stick drawing the Old Masters. It is his eye, perfectly formed by study of the masterpieces of painting, which enables him to confront the tumultuous disorder of the outside world and place it instantaneously in a formal order of beauty. The poet Yves Bonnefoy has told me that when he was Henri's neighbour in the Alps of Haute Provence, he had to meet him at the coach stop at Simiane one day. They were crossing the sunlit and rather sleepy village square together when Yves saw Henri make a movement with his hand while talking. We later saw what he had captured by firing from the hip like the hero in a Western: an arcaded vantage-point with some young people and a few animals, all distributed in significant poses, and, above all, with all the pillars of the building perfectly vertical despite the offhand manner in which he had taken the photo. There's no doubt about it, Henri shoots faster than Lucky Luke - with this notable difference, that a single shot from the latter left people dead whereas Henri makes them live for ever.

When Mimi, my girlfriend, and I went to visit him in Vallauris with his nephew, the delightful Xavier Vilato, he was working on ceramics in the studio of the potter Ramie. There were seven or eight of us in all, and Picasso had decided to show us his studios on the hills overlooking Vallauris. They were giant barns, and when Picasso made to open the largest of the doors I realised for the first time just how small he was, for the key, attached to a chain on his belt, only just reached the key-hole.What he particularly wanted to show us were the huge surfaces waiting on the walls for the moment he would paint the compositions of War and Peace, destined for the disused chapel of Vallauris. ""It's big, isn't it?"" he kept asking all round. ""Oh yes, maitre,"" everyone chorused back, this being the required response at all times. ""It's as big as the Sistine Chapel,"" he added. In Paris, to make a bit of money, I had just finished translating a book on the Sistine Chapel into English. I knew perfectly well, therefore, what its dimensions were, and without even thinking about it, a ""No"" slipped out of my mouth. It was indeed as though Picasso had never heard the word before, since he asked all round, disbelieving: ""What did he say?""I repeated what I had said, explaining why, but he interrupted me to declare in a loud voice: ""Well, almost,"" glaring at me with his dark eyes. ""And that's not all,"" he went on. ""I now have to paint them. Matisse, of course, would just lay on a few flowing lines and it would be done. But I, Picasso, will have to work much harder. It's dreadful!"" My English sense of humour led me to open my mouth for a second unfortunate time. ""Yes; but console yourself, maitre. Once it's finished, it will be even more dreadful."" I intended this as a compliment to the terribilita of Picasso; instead, everyone present gave a cry of horror, and Vilato was so alarmed that he dragged me out of the studio, and I didn't even get to hear Picasso's reaction.Just the same, I caught up again with the procession when it was looking at the ceramics workshop, crammed with daring inventions. (It had all begun with Joan Mir making a few ceramics with his friend, the great Catalan potter Artigas. When Picasso saw them, he decided to try his hand, and in a year had turned out 1,760 works!) We finally came to the studio reserved for works in progress. The room was long and narrow, and while Picasso held forth with the women at one end, I wandered around with Xavier examining things at the other. A matador's sword was hanging on the wall, and taking it to be a collector's item I mumbled to Xavier that it was almost certainly not sharp. In a bound Picasso was at our side, grabbed the sword from the wall and placed its tip against my throat: ""Not sharp, hey? Shall I press down then?"" With a roll of the eyes, I didn't utter a word, begged for mercy and the master returned, triumphant, to the women. Xavier separated me once and for all from the assembled company, saying gloomily: ""It's just too bad. He doesn't like you.""Two years later, recovering from an operation for peritonitis, I was convalescing at Mimi's father's home behind Grasse. I felt very weak. My survival had been a miracle of friendship. I had been rushed into the hospital at Sevres, where my friend Charles Odic, the mayor of the town, was also head doctor. On the evening of the operation, Odic was dining in Paris, but in the middle of the meal had stood up to drive out to the hospital and see how the operation was getting on. He found the surgeon sewing me back up, saying there was nothing to be done with such a bouillabaisse. Odic begged him to reconsider the case of his young friend...I felt just strong enough to do, say, a few small reliefs in terracotta, and bizarrely I thought of Picasso at Vallauris, who could open the doors of any pottery studio to me. Mimi was in Spain, and I had taken the big, light-blue Dodge to drive to Golfe Juan. On my way down from Vallauris to the coast, I saw a mother and child waiting at the bus stop with their bathing things under their arms. I offered to take them to the beach, and they got in, delighted. A few moments later, I was overtaken by a Vespa. Recognising the driver, I muttered under my breath: ""It's that cretin Pignon."" Needless to say, the woman sitting next to me was Madame Edouard Pignon, the writer Helene Parmelin in other words, and hardly had we arrived at the beach than I saw her explaining to her second-rate painter husband what a pig I was.IT WAS A BEACH TYPICAL of the Cote d'Azur, with a hundred or so people tanning themselves under a beautiful sun and thinking of nothing. In reality, of course, everyone was thinking of only one thing. They all knew that on the dot of noon Picasso would arrive at the beach and sink his parasol in the sand like an emperor's standard. The waiter at the restaurant nearby said that Picasso was so punctual that he could set his watch by his arrival each day. And here he was, with most of the bathers already on their feet, walking towards him. Having only just arrived, I found myself standing next to him and, since I was among the first, was able to ask him if, later on, he would care to look at a few photos of my work. ""There's nothing I enjoy more than looking at photos. See you later,"" and he ran down to the water for a dip.Pleased with the way things were turning out, I went for a swim, then sat down on my towel to take a look at this unusual beach. All of a sudden, Francoise Gilot arrived. The previous year, she had walked out of Picasso's life, declaring with great style that she didn't want to live with a national monument any more. Now she had brought her two children to see their father during the holidays. I knew her well. Before meeting Picasso, she had had a boyfriend, Luc Simon, a young painter the same age as me, and since the break-up had gone back to live with him. Being figurative artists the pair of us, a certain camaraderie had grown up between Luc and myself, and just recently he had settled down with Francoise in the rue du Val de Grace, not far from my studio in the Latin Quarter. I had been there for dinner several times, to talk about art late into the night, with the children Claude and Paloma tucked up in their cots in a corner.This explains why Francoise made straight for me that morning on the beach to bid me a friendly ""Bonjour"". At that precise moment, I noticed Picasso's piercing gaze fixed on us in the distance, and it became agonisingly clear to me that to engage in conversation with this contentious beauty would be to rule out all chance of speaking to Picasso again and showing him my work. It was a predicament worthy of Corneille, and to wriggle out of it I acted like a coward. I lowered my eyes and remained silent when Francoise said ""Bonjour"" for the second time.At that point she understood. Understood above all that I was a miserable creature unworthy of her interest and she turned on her heels. I was upset by this, and when I focused my attentions on the beach once more, it was to see everyone leaving. Picasso himself came rushing out of the water and disappeared with a group of friends into the restaurant on the beach. Soon I was the only one left and, with a heavy heart, started gathering up my affairs. At that moment Picasso came out of the restaurant and said: ""Aren't you coming?"" ""But..."" ""Come on, come and have lunch, old man.""I thus found myself seated at table opposite Picasso, together with a number of other artists, among them Pignon and the sculptor Adam, whom I knew slightly. I was astonished to see that none of them uttered a single word, being quite happy just to be eating at the master's table. The master, on the other hand, talked a great deal, and I, therefore, who greatly enjoy a good conversation, turned out to be his only interlocutor. This time, I had my work cut out. Pablo's talk was every bit as inventive as his art and was littered with jokes and booby-traps. ""Where do you live?"" (He used the familiar form ""tu"" when addressing me, as is de rigueur among artists, great or small.)On learning that I lived in the Latin Quarter, he asked me where exactly. ""Not far from Maubert-Mutualite."" He was overjoyed. ""Maubert is all I know. I even have a canvas of the place Maubert- Mutualite. Now, who painted it? You must know him. A curious fellow. I can't remember what he did for a living: a baker, a postman, a station-master? No, I've got it, he was a customs man."" He was referring to the Douanier Rousseau painting with the place Maubert in the background, Les Representants des puissances etrangeres viennent saluer la Republique francaise en signe de paix, which formerly belonged to Picasso and is now in the Musee Picasso in Paris.Our conversation continued gaily, then in came some Spanish dancers touring the coast, friends, of course, of Pablo. Before long, the woman in the company, a beauty, had climbed on to the table and broken into a wild dance. The noise was deafening, and I was just saying to myself how marvellous it was to have lunched with Picasso and too bad about the photos, when all of a sudden he clapped his hands and called for silence, saying: ""Yes, but that's not all. We have here a young artist who has come to show us his work."" It was a little glimpse of Picasso's cruel side. All my fellow artists' eyes were now focused unkindly on me, as I laid out the few works I had accomplished to date. There were busts of children, done to make money, that Picasso passed over in silence, a few reliefs and, finally, Barcelona Tram, my first, recently completed high relief. It is one of my good works, one on which I can be judged, and Picasso's enthusiasm was immediate. (It's only lately that I have understood Picasso's emotional fixation on that city. Moreover, the scene depicted in my relief was the facade of the Estacin di Francia, the station from which Picasso had set out more than once for Paris.)He told me that he liked the work because it was my own, wasn't cosmopolitan or in keeping with the style of the day. Thereupon, he called Adam over to come and look at the Tram. Adam, who made bulky abstract forms, looked at it and declared: ""Yeah, it's not bad, but it's not sculpture."" To which Picasso retorted: ""It's precisely because it's not sculpture that I like it. Sculpture that's just sculpture gives me the shits."" Adam, sensing the remark was aimed at him, hurried back to his seat.Picasso continued to sing my praises, before adding: ""You're an English artist."" I deflated at once, but Picasso, seeing my disappointment, hastened to reassure me that he was very fond of English art, and without a moment's hesitation or a single omission rattled off in chronological order all the important English artists from Hogarth down to the turn of the 20th century. ""But nowadays there's no English art any more. It's become cosmopolitan"" - a word he was fond of - ""like that sculptor, what's his name? You know the one."" I didn't dare breathe. ""M-M-Moo-Moo,"" he went on, tapping me on the chest. ""Moore,"" I timidly suggested. ""That's it, Moore. He's the same thing."" I could hardly believe it. Moore, who had had the honour of seeing Picasso painting Guernica, being talked about in this way. I should add that in 1954 there was little chance of Picasso knowing much, or even anything at all, about Francis Bacon. By way of conclusion, Picasso told me to go and see Kahnweiler in Paris and to tell him he had sent me, a spectacular recommendation. Only on the road back, still glowing with pleasure from my afternoon with Picasso, did I remember that I hadn't asked him a thing about the potters in Vallauris!As it happens, I didn't go to Kahnweiler's, I didn't take advantage of the recommendation that thousands of artists would have envied me, and here is why. Roughly one year earlier, there had been a big private view of Picasso's work at Kahnweiler's old gallery in the rue d'Astorg. At the time, I was desperately searching for somewhere I could use as a studio, and it occurred to me that since everyone who was anyone in the Paris art world would be present at this event, it would be an excellent moment to hand out a leaflet at the entrance to the gallery saying that I would accept anything, anywhere, that I might use as a studio. That is exactly what happened.I spent two uncomfortable hours standing outside the gallery pestering people, and when I had nothing left to hand out I went inside to see the exhibition. In those days I saw a good deal of the fine arts delegate for the British Council in Paris, Frank McEwen, and I found him there with his friends, among whom was Georges Charensol from Radiodiffusion Francaise. Charensol was rounding people up to talk about the exhibition, and instead of doing it in the rooms of the gallery, he was taking his group down to the radio studios. Frank, who was taking part, suggested it would be interesting to have the views of a young artist, myself it just so happened, and Charensol said fine, good idea.There were some important figures at the studio. Kahnweiler himself, Michel Leiris, Andre Fraigneau and three or four others. While these leading lights were singing the great man's praises, the rest of us were asked to make sounds as though we were in the midst of a private view. For the same purposes of reconstruction, Charensol said at the end: ""Ah, but I can see above the heads of the crowd a young English artist. This way, laddie, don't be nervous. Tell us what you think of Picasso."" I cleared my throat: ""Picasso is the king."" ""Bravo, bravo,"" said Kahnweiler and his company. ""Provided,"" I added, ""we understand that today le roi s'amuse."" Bam! that was the end of the live broadcast. Kahnweiler started screaming: ""Who let that little cretin in?"" With everyone furious and Frank none too pleased, I scurried off home. Some time after this, with all the nonchalance of youth, I returned to the gallery to see an Andre Masson exhibition. Kahnweiler must have seen me from his glass-fronted office. A secretary came to show me the door. How could I possibly return there, even with a word from Picasso on my behalf? I had my pride.I met Picasso once or twice after that. I introduced my mother to him the following year, and he very graciously shook hands with her and did a little pirouette to show that, though he didn't know a word of English, he did know how to dance. My mother's reaction was equally amusing. The moment we were in the car I asked her how she felt after meeting the man everyone was talking about. ""Very clean. He's very clean."" ""For God's sake, is that all you have to say?"" But it was true, he was always very clean, impeccably turned out.Another time, I was with my two English friends, Ralph and Pauline Daubeny, who had driven all the way to the hotel at Eden Roc in a small Austin that Ralph had painted by hand on the eve of their departure. It wasn't until they parked their car among the Cadillacs and Rolls-Royces that they noticed in the strong sunlight that the brushmarks didn't even reach all the way down the bodywork, the bottom of which was of a different colour. They wanted a photo of Picasso and myself, so we stood there with our arms round each other's waist waiting for Ralph to fire the camera. There was nothing to be done. The camera, like the car, wasn't made for the Cote d'Azur. Impatient, Picasso, though photographed a million times over, didn't want to miss this one either. On all fours in the sand, he tinkered with the machine and, by golly, got it working again. We resumed our pose. We then said our farewells, everyone was very pleased, and there were the usual promises to send the photos on.A few weeks later, Ralph wrote to me from England to inform me that the photos were fantastic, and that he would be ""sending them on"". Nothing arrived, and a few months later I learned that my two charming friends had decided to divorce. They then did precisely that, and in the upheavals my photos with Picasso were lost.I MET HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON in 1973 thanks to Sam Szafran, who frequents the upper crust of Parisian society and is very generous in introducing his friends. The period of his great photos, or of his great reportages rather, was over, and he was returning to his first love, art. He had painted before the war, but now, having spent a lot of time with Alberto Giacometti, his only aim was to master drawing with the aid of an HB pencil and a few sheets of paper. He would pick up his famous Leica from time to time, and the result would be as extraordinary as ever; but, as I have said, there just wasn't the same interest any more.He lives in a fifth-floor duplex in the rue de Rivoli, overlooking the Tuileries gardens and above the apartment formerly inhabited by Victor Choquet, the friend and collector of the Impressionists. This means that Cezanne and Monet had often looked at the same view, and many of Cartier- Bresson's drawings take up the same landscape scenes first painted by Monet, Renoir and Pissarro. In this low-ceilinged apartment full of charm, Henri hangs works by his artist friends and receives a steady flow of interesting company, in general involved in the arts and literature. The food and drink served by his wife, the photographer Martine Franck, are first-class, and at table Cartier-Bresson gives free rein to his youthful enthusiasm for an endless array of subjects.Occasionally, this turns into equally spontaneous rage if something doesn't suit him - for example, the day he saw me putting water in my wine: ""What, you're putting water in my lovely wine! Stupid Englishman. Get out!"" I had got as far as the lift-cage when Henri caught up with me. I mention this to show that even today at his great age there isn't a trace of decrepitude in the man.One day he showed me some drawings he had made of the panorama of Paris from the roof above his flat. An excellent draughtsman, his love of Giacometti's work had, in my view, made him overemphasise the lines of structure, disembodying his subject, and I told him that it wouldn't do. ""Well, then, I'm going to take you up on to the roof and watch you do it,"" said Henri firmly. We had arranged to do this a few days after, but the great heat wave of the summer of 1976 had started and I wanted to put off the experiment until later. Cartier-Bresson, however, once he gets an idea into his head, won't let it drop. Out we went, then, on to the sea of white-hot zinc of the roofs of the rue de Rivoli, only to see before us a young girl lying naked on her back, sunbathing. With apologetic smiles, we were preparing to step across her body when Henri, deciding the situation merited better, disappeared down the hatch and came back with a bottle of champagne. The young lady accepted a glass with good grace, while rolling over slightly on to her front.Once this interlude was over, we advanced as far as the chimney that was to be my vantage-point. And, from there, we saw in a window further down a slender young girl with a pink turban on her head, the spitting image of one of the famous photos Cartier-Bresson had brought back from India or Bali. It wasn't that, of course, simply a young woman who'd just washed her hair, and the turban was merely a coloured towel. Hardly had I recovered than, looking up in the direction of the great view towards the Sacre Coeur and Montmartre, I saw a Zeppelin like a white cigar circling the white dome. In 30 years of living in Paris, I had never seen such a thing. Astonishing. Then Henri left me on my own while I got set up and, looking around me, I discovered that the Zeppelin had vanished, the girl in the turban as well. Nor was there any sign of the naked woman.The whole thing had been the charms that life puts on show for him wherever Henri the magician passes. For luck and fate go with him always. During a stay in India, he was received by Gandhi in his tent. When he came out, the man going in was none other than Gandhi's assassin, and Cartier-Bresson found himself a witness to the most incredible scenes, standing with his camera just below Nehru when he leaned over the wall of the palace to announce the death to the people.ON THE CHIMNEY, I showed Henri that to make a drawing of that particular view you had to begin at the top and finish at the bottom. As moreover I was drawing, as is my wont, directly in ink, Henri gave a nod of the head and did not stay long. On his way down, from the window below, he fired off once with his Leica, and, while my drawing is good, his photo is extraordinary. There are two figures on a roof, myself cap on head (because of the heat) and the chimney with its own hat, and, starting from my profile, a whole zigzag of chimneys and asperities likewise profiled against the sky all the way down to the bottom right-hand corner of the photo. On the left, behind my back, is the bare horizontal of the roof, and below, filling the left-hand corner, the perfect black square of an open window. Like all Cartier-Bresson's photos, it is framed by a thin black band. This indicates that there has been no recropping, that it is simply what the camera saw. At the same time, Cartier- Bresson's photographs are of a complexity and precision of composition which almost defy understanding.Henri Cartier-Bresson is essentially an artist. He has lived all his life in Paris, a city of art and artists. The Louvre is right outside his door, and you can still see him there today, sitting on his shooting stick drawing the Old Masters. It is his eye, perfectly formed by study of the masterpieces of painting, which enables him to confront the tumultuous disorder of the outside world and place it instantaneously in a formal order of beauty. The poet Yves Bonnefoy has told me that when he was Henri's neighbour in the Alps of Haute Provence, he had to meet him at the coach stop at Simiane one day. They were crossing the sunlit and rather sleepy village square together when Yves saw Henri make a movement with his hand while talking. We later saw what he had captured by firing from the hip like the hero in a Western: an arcaded vantage-point with some young people and a few animals, all distributed in significant poses, and, above all, with all the pillars of the building perfectly vertical despite the offhand manner in which he had taken the photo. There's no doubt about it, Henri shoots faster than Lucky Luke - with this notable difference, that a single shot from the latter left people dead whereas Henri makes them live for ever.In those days, I had a house in Provence, at Menerbes opposite the Luberon, and Henri and Martine were installed in an old farmhouse near Reillanne on the Grand Luberon. Our two houses were equidistant, 20 kilometres to either side of Apt. It is at Apt that the Luberon mountain chain is divided into the Grand and the Petit Luberon by the valley leading down to Lourmarin on the south slope. Though close to one another, our two landscapes were very different. While I looked straight out on to the Petit Luberon, abrupt and spectacular, across a cheerful valley rich in vineyards and fruit trees, Henri was perched on the side of a mountain much like any other in the Alpine forelands, but with a splendid panorama of wheat fields and pasture-land before him. We shared the same pure climate and the same beautiful sun, which is extremely important for artists like ourselves who like to see.Alas, between us ran a wicked, typically Provencal road lined with plane trees whose roots made bumps in the surface all the way to Forcalquier, where there was an arts centre in an old building run by a mutual friend of ours, Lucien Henry. It was here, moreover, that Henri held one of his first exhibitions of drawings. Since then, exhibitions of his drawings have been held pretty much all over the world, but I would be very surprised if any of them equalled that at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts in Paris in 1989, prodigiously well hung by his publisher, Robert Delpire.Here is another side of Henri Cartier-Bresson. In 1984, I had just finished my monument for Montreal and needed a photo of the entire sculpture. I had to have it, moreover, that weekend, for the work would be leaving the moulder's studio the coming Monday. I thought of a-young disciple of Henri's, Marc, who had the plate camera essential for art photos. I called Henri to get Marc's phone number. He asked me why I wanted it and, when I explained, said in an annoyed tone: ""But I can't do the photo for you, I don't have the time."" I assured him that Marc was the only one who could do it, and grudgingly he gave me the number. Five minutes later, he phoned back to say he would do the photo himself, and that I would have to go and pick him up in the car to drive the 30 kilometres to Brie- Comte- Robert. Knowing that he didn't have the right instrument for the job, I was put out by his announcement, but, since this great friend of mine was also a great man, there was nothing further to be said.While I was rolling pleasantly along towards our destination, Henri suddenly said: ""If you continue driving at this speed, I'll throw myself out of the car."" We were off to a good start and, sure enough, the moment we entered the Haligon studio in Brie, Cartier- Bresson, seeing how enormous the monument was, cried out: ""What! I can't photograph a thing like that!"" (He always told me his interest was exclusively for small sculptures, Giacometti's or those of his brother-in-law, Pierre Josse.) It was my turn now to shout: ""You're the one who insisted on coming. I wanted Marc. But I have to have the photo at all costs.""We both stood there sulking. At that moment, the moulder Olivier Haligon pointed out a problem to me at one spot on the sculpture, and while I was giving it my attention, someone called out my name. I turned round in the direction of the call and was astounded to see Cartier-Bresson at the top of a tall, metal ladder that he hadn't even bothered to pull away from the wall. The photo was done. It was not the documentary photo I wanted, but a marvellous image of an artist lost in his great work. It served as the frontispiece for my catalogue at the Pompidou Centre, and Cartier-Bresson included it in his album. I have related this anecdote to illustrate the sprightliness of the man, who was then 76. In the Midi, he photographed me on some land near Menerbes which dropped sheer down to the valley. To get the angle he wanted, I saw him run up the embankment backwards. Try doing it.He took many portraits of me, none of which quite came off. Though he has taken some great portraits, the best are always those taken in situ and not the head alone. I have in mind the portrait of William Faulkner and his dog, or that of Colette with her maid standing behind her. Everything he has done of me in a context is very good. He was present outside the Jeu de Paume in the Tuileries - he only had to come down from his apartment - on the day of Arctic cold in January 1986 when the installation of The Crowd in bronze was inaugurated. He and Martine took the usual photos of me and the officials standing in front of the work, but the one that is always used is yet again an oblique view from behind, with me alone looking round - in response to a call - into Henri's Leica.Afterwards, we all beat a retreat to the nearest cafe on the rue de Rivoli for a hot grog. The people from the ministry were delighted to be sharing a table with Henri Cartier-Bresson, a living legend, but the business of the Glass Pyramid of the Louvre was still fresh (Henri and I were against this monstrosity), and Cartier- Bresson seized the opportunity of having these gentlemen in front of him to tell them yet again what he thought of it all. Since more than a grog was needed to warm up the atmosphere, we soon parted. Good old Henri!Clearly, the fact that he's nice-looking and not remotely threatening has made it easier for him to slip into all kinds of situations, record them on film then leave without being spotted. This is also the place to note that most photographers confine themselves to the dramatic and the tragic, and even a photographer out to amuse, like Robert Doisneau, has his subjects pose for him, thereby killing off any vivacity. Henri Cartier-Bresson gives us life in its entirety, the spectacular and the dramatic but also the moments of unruffled happiness or unbridled mirth, as a result of which at an exhibition of his photos we always hear people laughing. The mixture of the serious and the comical is always very potent in a creator and gives his work an added dimension.This ability to feel optimistic about life is a rare gift in this brilliant man. Not long ago, he was about to undergo an operation of some gravity for a man of his age. He told me about it in a little casual note which he signed ""En-rit"" - laughing about it.Henri, just back from a voyage, phones to tell me that, during a stop- over in Berlin, he visited a museum where he noticed in the rooms a man of imposing presence. He was introduced to him. It was ""your ambassador"" the British ambassador. ""Ah, Monsieur Cartier- Bresson, you've taken a lot of photographs in our country. I hope you never had any difficulties doing so,"" said the latter politely. ""On the contrary,"" replied Henri, ""every time I pointed my camera at one of your fellow countrymen he would duck and say `sorry', because in his modesty he thought I was photographing something behind him."" mThis is an extract from At Work in Paris: Raymond Mason on Art and Artists (Thames & Hudson, pounds 18.95).

This remark by Pablo Picasso accompanies a picture of a pewter piece by crafter and author Sandy Griffiths in her new book Pewter Impressions.She demonstrates how pewter relief modelling can be used to add unique decorative touches around the home, and says relief modelling is a completely different craft from cast pewter.Her book illustrates how thin sheets of the metal with raised or relief designs, created with special tools, can be used to decorate window shutters, candles and create beautiful finishes on mosaics.Griffiths, who has been working with pewter for 10 years, is an experienced crafter. Her studio is in Devil's Peak, Cape Town, where she has been teaching pewter and several other crafts for many years.""Working with pewter is surprisingly easy,"" she says. ""It is a lovely soft metal, an alloy of tin and other metals, sometimes lead, which is easy to mould. There are only two basic techniques used in the art of pewter - low relief and high relief - and once you have learnt these techniques, the world of pewter is yours.""Griffiths says many people are inhibited about being creative as they believe they cannot draw, but this is easily solved by using the tracing paper which is part of a pewter kit. ""No drawing skills are required.""The idea for a craft book on the metal came about after Griffiths tried to source information for her workshops.""I was presenting workshops at a large craft expo and as there was nothing available in print on pewter art, I put some notes together and sold them. Wislia Metz, of Metz Press, who specialises in craft books, was at the expo, and she asked me if I would write a book on pewter. In a moment of complete madness I said 'Sure'.

So I just did it.""Pewter Impressions is her third book on the subject. It includes a collection of more than 30 original pewter projects, illustrated with gorgeous photographs of all the finished projects as well as templates for all designs used in the book.It has easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions and clear photographs. It starts at the beginning so that novices do not need to go back to earlier books.Beginners' exercises explain the basics, teaching crafters how to apply the art of embossing and then add lustre, radiance and dimension to their design. These are followed by a wide range of stunning projects which include combining pewter with mosaics, canvas, glass paint, gold and silver leaf foil, crystals and more, offering a variety of looks and finishes.The projects vary from fabulous frames and beautiful boxes to gifts and decor items.In addition to the projects, Pewter Impressions covers:-- Essential tools and how to use them.-- Tracing and transferring patterns.-- Low and high relief embossing.-- Moulding-- Texturing-- Adding colour and patina.-- Cutting out and sticking designs to various surfaces.Griffiths says one of her favourites is the gift tag project, a beginner's exercise: ""They are simple, elegant and look really unique. You can let your imagination run wild while dreaming up designs or simply trace mine. And they are so easy to make.""Her other books, Easy Pewter Projects and Pewter, are popular. She also has a DVD, filmed by Andrew Ingram, called Pewter It, aimed at beginners. It is a hands-on workshop giving the viewer a close-up view of low and high relief creations. It also covers gold leafing and applying glass stain to pewter.New to pewter?

Among this king's amusements was the commedia dell'arte, a troupe of Italian actors--dressed as characters Harlequin, Pierrot and Columbine--as well as jugglers and acrobats, these latter called saltimbanques from their jumping motions.When the king's mistress Mme. de Maintenon dismissed them from court in 1697, these actors and saltimbanques performed in public, traveling to newer locations. Their descendants appear in works from Honor√© Daumier to Edouard Manet to Georges Seurat. Perhaps the most famous is Pablo Picasso's ""Family of Saltimbanques"" (1905).The grandest picture of his pre-Cubist period--it measures over 7 by 7 1/2 feet--this work has been in the National Gallery of Art's collection since 1963, a bequest of patron Chester Dale. It moved to the Gallery's East Building when it opened 40 years ago this weekend. There, in 1979, we began a joint art-history and technical study of the picture.""Who are these rambling acrobats?"" the poet Rainer Maria Rilke asked in his ""Fifth Duino Elegy"" (1923) after seeing it in the summer of 1915. Far from being a random, anonymous group as they are in other treatments of the subject, the figures here have specific identities. Harlequin bears Picasso's features; that of the small acrobat those of his friend, the poet Max Jacob. The deep-browed acrobat and the ample jester resemble, respectively, colleagues Andr√© Salmon and Guillaume Apollinaire.But the painting did not originally appear as it does now. Freely brushed and near-transparent paint areas in the foreground and the woman's hat suggested to us that Picasso had made changes to an earlier composition. So in 1980 we made X-radiographs of the entire picture, a process that, combined with subsequent art-historical research, disclosed the painting's complex metamorphosis.A crucial clue about Picasso's original intentions came from Fernande Olivier, who recalls in her published journal that Picasso painted ""a large canvas, a group of acrobats on a plain. Some are resting, the others working.... If I remember correctly, this canvas was repainted several times.""Although she didn't mention what happened to that ""large"" picture, Olivier's description fit the ""Circus Family"" (1904-05), a small drawing in the Baltimore Museum of Art. Looking at the X-radiographs, we found the lost painting embedded under the surface of ""Family of Saltimbanques.""The spectral presence of the ""Circus Family"" was one of many stunning discoveries that we made. In penetrating all the layers of ""Saltimbanques,"" these technical images captured a second picture, this one the mirror image of a mid-sized gouache, ""Two Acrobats With a Dog"" (1905), now owned by the Museum of Modern Art. Pervaded with a blue tonality, this work is closer to the current ""Family of Saltimbanques,"" presenting two costumed performers standing in a barren landscape.The X-radiographs also disclosed that changes had been made to the third composition, or the topmost layer of the painting.Three separate galaxies of saltimbanques now formed, serving to navigate us through Picasso's months-long campaign on the National Gallery's painting. The first group is from the initial ""Circus Family"" layer, a second set is related to the composition of two young acrobats, and a third is connected to the present state of the painting.One of us (Ms. Hoenigswald), after technically examining Picasso's work for decades, has found a pattern of his compositions evolving directly from his earlier imagery. We see that in the ""Family of Saltimbanques,"" where one layer morphs into a second and a third. Moreover, he intentionally leaves clues, so-called pentimenti, revealing, for example, a shift in the woman's hat, or the thin leg under the boy's puffy pants, and cracks revealing unrelated colors or obscured textures, all to draw the viewer's attention to the picture's process.Picasso's life played a role in the ""Family of Saltimbanques."" Already noticed as part of the avant garde in Barcelona, he moved to Paris in 1900 seeking recognition in this center of Modernism. A year of obscurity led next to his traveling between the cities until 1904, when he returned to Paris, meeting Olivier, Salmon and Apollinaire (he knew Jacob earlier). In December of that year, these friends became regular visitors to the Cirque Medrano, a local small circus show where Picasso sketched many acrobats backstage.Picasso transformed this experience into his large canvas's initial layer of a ""Circus Family."" But the genius of the ""Family of Saltimbanques"" came when he portrayed his artist friends in the final picture, and transformed their status as outsiders by identifying his characters with the historic, wandering troupe of once royal entertainers. The isolation of Picasso's figures, presented in this virtual frieze of symbolic and poetic images, lifts the work to greatness.Mr. Carmean is a former curator and Ms. Hoenigswald is a former paintings conservator, both at the National Gallery of Art.Credit: By E.A.

Huge and knotted, they clasped the rugby ball which had earned England a place in World Cup history in 2003.The iconic winning moment had been delicately captured first in wood and then in bronze.For Isabel, the technical sculpture of her brother-in-law's hands marked a turning point in her career away from the strict technique of restoration work to the freedom of sculpture.""The World Cup was very exciting because Lawrence was in it. I thought it would be great to commemorate it in some way, so I asked if I could make a sculpture of his hands.""I cast his hands in plaster and then I carved it out of one solid chunk of wood-- the ball is only touching on three points which made the carving of the ball very difficult as well as hands being technically very hard anyway.""It marked a letting go from my old way of working. It was the turning point and I realised I had to make sculptures.""As a teenager Isabel was reluctant to follow into the fine art world her family had entered.""I did shy away from it for a long time -- you try and break the mould when you're a teenager.""I left home and went to work with mentally handicapped children. I loved my job, but things didn't work out so I decided I would go to art school and see what it was like.""My dad is an antique dealer and he works with early oak furniture. He said why didn't I try carving, so I went to an evening class and I loved it.""Isabel studied the art of carving and gilding -- and polychrome finishes -- for three years.She supplemented her knowledge and income doing restoration work on Robert Adam, Chippendale and Thomas Hope furniture.""I worked for two different carving workshops in London. One of them worked on beautiful furniture from Lady Diana's family, the Spencers.""I worked in restoration for eight years. I wanted to learn my craft. Wood is a difficult medium to work with and if you don't learn your technique properly then you are limited in what you can do.""Her first wood carving was of Aphrodite. Carved in deep relief the Goddess is feminine and soft.Isabel has captured her beauty and sexuality in carefully chiselled features and grains in the wood.On the reverse is a shepherd carved in shallow relief because, Isabel jokes, 'he is a mere mortal'. A knot in the wood looked like a sheep's bottom to Isabel, so she carved the animal meekly resting over the shepherd's shoulders.She used medieval techniques to paint the background, by grinding natural pigments and mixing them with animal glue. The result is a stunning piece of carving, seemingly simplistic yet every feature has been chiselled to perfection.I ask her if it's hard to part with her artwork considering the physical and emotional effort she carves into each piece.""To begin with it was very strange delivering a piece like Aphrodite -- you feel like you're leaving something behind."" But she reassures me: ""It's great that it sells and I'm okay with it now.""Isabel's portfolio is full of ornate carvings -- mirrors, small heads and hands.""I'm fascinated by hands -- they say a lot about a person. For me they describe the soul.""I carved my own hands out of a piece of stone. I held them up and copied them, had a look and carved a bit more. Using stone was very different to wood. It's a great medium because I find it stops me from being too detailed.""One of her clients asked for a carving of his teenage daughter's forearm. Isabel cast it and carved it in wood and now the lone limb sits eerily on his desk, the fingers gently holding his business cards.""He has a great sense of humour and it is the sort of sculpture people used to have in their homes.""Other sculptures include an athletic looking boxing hare carved out of lime wood, a mother and child relief and a charging bull cast in bronze, which was eagerly snapped up by dealers and taken to the South of France, Monaco and Miami.Exploring sculpture work has given Isabel 'a freedom' in her artwork and the confidence to push herself and hone her own style.She has been successful with public art commissions, including the creation of a wooden apple core with aluminium pips for the playground at Stoke Gabriel Primary School.In between commissions, she has spent the last five years chain-sawing and chiselling 11 trees destined for the chop into towering pieces of art at a housing estate in Brixham.A seagull, a fox and a buzzard perch and climb on one tree, while a figurine of St Mary looks out to sea from another tree.""The first one took me three months to complete. It has been a labour of love. I started with fine, fiddly stuff in my restoration work, but you have to be very decisive when you use a chain saw.""Sculpting is always really frustrating. It doesn't matter what medium you're working in, it's always a real struggle. There comes a point when you think 'Why aim I doing this, it's too hard' but you are driving to continue and make it right. Sculpting with a chain saw is slightly worse. The chain saw is heavy, it's dusty work and it's noisy.""I come home covered in dust and my arms are aching, but there's something strangely satisfying once you've done it.""Isabel's mother Lydia Corbett (nee Sylvette David) was Picasso's muse for three months in 1954.The image of the striking, insouciant teenager with the high pony tail, her blonde hair cascading down to her shoulders can be found in up to 50 of Picasso's works.Thousands of women appropriated her style including the then unknown Brigitte Bardot, before she became a Hollywood icon.In 1965 Isabel was taken to meet Picasso. In a recent interview her mother recalled the visit: ""It was moving but he couldn't hear so well. He was sweet. My two-year-old daughter was turning him round and round in a swivel chair and he remarked that she was like an English painting.""Isabel refers to her mother's experience as a 'fairy tale', but I wonder if it's something which at times has overshadowed both of them.Interestingly Isabel finds herself drawn to hairstyles as a means of inspiration for some of her carvings.""Hairstyles sometimes inspire me, like a thick plait or a high ponytail. I did a few sculptures with ponytails in them and I thought 'what is this about', but I worked through it.""Now in her late 40s, Isabel is hitting her artistic stride. She is experimenting with her skill through her ideas and concepts, which have 'stacked up' over the years while having her three children and are finally been set free.The Dallaglio hands (her sister Alice is Dallaglio's longterm partner and the mother of the couple's three children) symbolise a 'personal freedom of work'.Isabel teaches wood carving privately.

""For me, there are only two kinds of women--goddesses and doormats,"" he told his postwar partner, Fran√ßoise Gilot, as she recounted in Life with Picasso, her 1964 memoir. Since Picasso's death in 1973, the works emerging from these liaisons--and the gripping tales behind them--have provided fodder for countless museum and gallery shows. In the past three years alone, Gagosian Gallery, in conjunction with the Picasso biographer John Richardson, mounted two well-received New York exhibitions, Picasso and Marie-Th√©r√®se: L'Amour Fou in 2011, and Picasso and Fran√ßoise Gilot in 2012. (On October 28, the gallery will open Picasso & the Camera, curated, like the others, by Richardson.) Now Pace Gallery, which has presented many Picasso shows of its own, will focus an extensive, two-gallery exhibition around the least celebrated and most controversial of the artist's amours, Jacqueline Roque, a dark-haired divorc√©e 45 years the artist's junior, who became his second wife in 1961. Their relationship endured for more than 20 years, until Picasso's death at 91, making Jacqueline, who took his name when they married, his longest-lasting consort and most persistent muse. Yet she has inspired only a few exhibitions. The last was in 2006, at the Kunst Museum Pablo Picasso in M√ºnster, Germany. In part that's because Picasso's late work has often been dismissed as irrelevant and kitschy. But decades have elapsed since his death, and the work he produced while he was with Jacqueline is beginning to be hotly desired by collectors. Pace, which has organized seven shows around the late work since 1981, hopes to introduce audiences to the person who, despite all that's said of her, was arguably the most important love of Picasso's life. In a 1988 essay, Richardson called Picasso's late years ""L'√âpoque Jacqueline."" ""It is so free and full of love,"" says the Guggenheim Museum curator and Picasso scholar Carmen Gim√©nez of the master's work from this time. ""Jacqueline created peace for him.¬† That did not happen before."" Yet the paucity of shows about Jacqueline may also be related to the ambiguous role she played for Picasso's family and friends. Early on, she developed a reputation for being manipulative, avaricious and conniving, initially because she came between Picasso and Gilot. Once installed at La Californie, the artist's grand Cannes villa, she guarded his privacy jealously, shutting out even his children and grandchildren so he could focus on work. After his death, Jacqueline disappeared into seclusion for three years, emerging only to battle with his heirs over the disposition of his estate. And in 1986, still racked with grief over the loss of Monseigneur, as she called him, Jacqueline killed herself with a pistol at Notre-Dame de Vie, their castle in Mougins, becoming one of many Picasso intimates to die tragically. (Others include Walter, who hanged herself in 1977; Picasso's son Paolo by his first wife, the dancer Olga Khokhlova, who drank himself to death in 1975; and Paolo's son Pablito, who downed bleach after Jacqueline barred him from Picasso's funeral.) Their relationship--and Jacqueline's sphinxlike demeanor, as rendered in more than 125 artworks--will live again in Pace's Picasso & Jacqueline: The Evolution of Style, from October 31 through January 10, 2015. Nearly half of the work is drawn from the holdings of Picasso's heirs, and the rest from other private collections and museums, including the Centre Pompidou and the Museum of Modern Art. The exhibitions will include every sort of medium, from painting and sculpture to drawings, ceramics and prints. Only a handful will be for sale. ""There are more portraits of Jacqueline than any other woman in Picasso's life,"" says Arne Glimcher, Pace's founder. ""The range of interpretation of her image is quite extraordinary. We've selected works representing all of these moments, from the time he meets her and draws her like Ingres, till the end of his life, when his work was marked by wild expressionism. So you see the transformation of his late style only through these portraits of Jacqueline."" Glimcher worked on the show for five years with Catherine Hutin, Jacqueline's daughter, now in her late 60s and based in Paris. Hutin lived with the couple and, after her mother's death, inherited a large portion of Picasso's estate. Although Hutin was not Picasso's child, Glimcher notes, ""she lived longer with him than any of the other children and saw more work being made than anybody else, besides Jacqueline. She really knows the work inside out."" Most of the paintings and sculptures will be downtown, at Pace's Chelsea outpost at 534 West 25th St., with the bulk of the works on paper at 32 East 57th St. Also included are photographs by the Life photojournalist David Douglas Duncan, who began shooting the couple in 1956, when he stopped by La Californie on a whim, snapped Picasso in the bathtub and soon won carte blanche to shadow them for the rest of the artist's life. The prints, 56 in all, show the couple together--walking, talking and even holding hands just after marrying in secret. The photographs offer a glimpse into their unguarded private life at a time when they had closed so many out. Many depict Jacqueline in the shadows, watching Picasso work, a dynamic both evidently enjoyed. Now 98 and still living near Cannes, Duncan, who tends to irascibility, has little patience for Jacqueline's critics. ""To hell with that noise!"" he snaps. ""She closed the goddamn door to keep people out. She probably added 15 years to his life."" As one of a lucky few regularly welcomed, Duncan recalls he couldn't stay away for long, even though his docket was full of assignments. ""It was a hell of a story,"" he says. It began in 1952 when the 72-year-old artist, one of the most famous people in France, met the 27-year-old Roque at a pottery studio in Vallauris. He was making ceramics there, and she was a salesgirl. Although he was still entangled with Gilot, he wooed Roque by chalking a white dove on the wall of her house and sending her single red roses. His friends viewed her as ""not up to the job,"" Richardson recounts one of them saying in The Sorcerer's Apprentice, his 1999 memoir of his years in Picasso's inner circle. When Gilot, seemingly unaware of the new attachment, left Picasso a year after it began, Jacqueline suffered through their attempts to reconcile, as well as his dalliances with others. But she eventually won out, largely because she was slavishly reverent of him. Patrick O'Brian, another Picasso biographer, observed in 1976 that the artist recognized in her ""the devotion of a lifetime."" The art historian Barbara Rose, a contributor to Pace's catalog, puts it somewhat differently: ""She thought he was God and he thought he was God,"" Rose says. ""The two of them were in love with him."" Perhaps that's why, during their years together, Picasso became even more prolific than usual, as Jacqueline blithely neglected her daughter to run the household, monitor his social life and spend hours in the studio. Moved in turn by her classical profile, her almond-shaped eyes and her exotic features, Picasso cast her in his reworkings of French and Spanish masters like Manet and Vel√°zquez, which so obsessed him during his final years. One painting from 1954, Jacqueline avec une √âcharpe Noire, shows her draped in a black scarf that suggests a hijab, smiling enigmatically--a modern, Orientalist-inspired interpretation of El Greco's Lady in a Fur Wrap. Later that year, Jacqueline's habit of crouching on the floor, like an idealized odalisque, moved him to incorporate her form in a series of 15 paintings that deconstruct Eug√®ne Delacroix's 1834 Femmes d'Alger. (The Chelsea show will include a roomful of the many drawings, etchings and paintings Picasso made on this subject.) Jacqueline also appears in other homages, such as the cubist-style, sexualized rendering of Manet's 1863 Le D√©jeuner sur l'Herbe (1961), and the erotic 1968 etchings known as Suite 347, in which Picasso depicts Raphael and his model, la Fornarina, making love. But he also represented Jacqueline as herself, sculpting her likeness in bronze and painted sheet metal, and drawing her reading, playing with his children, petting her cat and just gazing into space. Duncan, in his 1988 book Picasso and Jacqueline, describes the artist's messy, crowded studio as being full of images of Jacqueline, ""who often appeared to be stepping out of one canvas into another of herself."" Overall, however sexualized or aggressive Picasso's characterization, there is also a serene, joyful quality to the work. Perhaps that's because, as Duncan recalls today, the couple's love for each other was abundantly evident. ""Absolutely, one hundred percent, no mention of anybody else ever,"" he insists. ""They loved each other from the first time they met, until they both died."" And today a depiction of that love lies with them in their joint grave at Vauvenargues, their ch√¢teau in Provence. At Jacqueline's funeral, Duncan tucked a photograph into her coffin: Taken in 1962, it shows her sitting with Picasso on the steps of La Californie with his portrait of her behind him. They snuggle together, laughing, waiting for the paint to dry.Credit: By Carol KinoWord count: 1568Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But it was only when he'd built his elegant home in Co Wexford that he had the space to emulate the work of his artistic idol'Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up,"" said Pablo Picasso, the defining artist of the 20th Century. His devoted fan, Lamaat Mahmood, had that very problem, but it's one he has been able to overcome --something which quickly becomes apparent as he conducts a guided tour of his fascinating home in Co Wexford.""Picasso,"" he says, pointing out a picture on the right-hand side of the hallway and then, turning to the left side, he points at another picture and says with a gentle note of pride, ""me"", and so it goes throughout the house. Lamaat has hung prints of Picasso's most iconic Cubist works everywhere, and alongside them can be found his own works, inspired by those of the Spanish giant.Lamaat's work is all quite recent because, even though he loved art as a child growing up in Lahore, he wasn't encouraged to pursue it. ""I wanted to be an artist, but my parents chose medicine for me. My first inspiration was Sadequain, a Pakistani painter. He also painted in the Cubist style, like Picasso. He was particularly known for his calligraphy. During the Islamicrevolution they burned his work; there's very little left,"" Lamaat muses.A seemingly easygoing sort, Lamaat doesn't resent the fact that he was directed into medicine instead of art by his parents -- he recognises that his father, a lawyer, and his late mother, a school headmistress, wanted the best for him. Fortunately, he enjoyed studying medicine and opted to specialise in anaesthesia, but he resolved quite early on that he would try to combine the two disciplines.""My sister did a masters in fine art and sculpture. At the time I had just finished medicine, and I started painting. I used her half-dried paints and her used brushes to paint landscapes and seascapes, but I was always interested in Cubism. I have a mathematical mind, I think that's why I was attracted to Cubism,"" he recalls. ""At that time I tried to do abstract works like Picasso's, but I couldn't. Then I came to Ireland and I stopped painting altogether,"" he says.He came initially for his training in anaesthesia but stayed to work, and he now holds a joint Irish/Pakistani passport. He moved around the country, starting with Wexford in 1995, then working in hospitals in Cork, Mayo and Kilkenny consecutively. He came back to Wexford General Hospital in 1998, and he works mainly in obstetrics and day surgery.He tried to resume his painting, but it didn't work out for him due to a combination of circumstances. The work routine at the hospital took time to get used to and he also had logistical problems; at the time he lived in quite a small house with no space for a studio. Then there was the whole question of trying to adapt to a different way of life. ""At first I didn't know anyone, then I made friends of all nationalities and it became easier,"" he says.He's just back from his annual month-long holiday in Pakistan, so he's in reflective mode. ""Each time I go home and come back, I feel quite homesick -- so homesick that I feel like a misfit. Eventually, after a few days at work, I get back into life here,"" he confides, adding that, conversely, he feels like a misfit in Lahore, too.""The ways there are so different to here. For example, I can't drive there. The way they drive -- you need a large horn and bumpers all around your car. My body freezes if I sit in the driver seat,"" he exclaims. ""And I can't shop. I'm used to shopping here, but there they are not polite. You can't be polite. You have to be abrupt. So my sister [he has three sisters] does it for me. And the climate! I've lived in Ireland so long I can't bear the heat, so I always visit in winter,"" he says in his accented-though-fluent English; he always spoke English at school and Urdu at home. He also speaks Punjabi, the language local to his hometown.Despite his conflicted feelings, Lamaat loves his native land and ensures that there are plenty of Pakistani mementos and artefacts throughout his home. He built the house in 2007 when he finally got the site he wanted in the Wexford countryside; and the necessary planning permission, which took a while.He designed the house himself and project-managed it. In the process he ensured that not only would it be big -- the ground floor is 4,000sq ft -- but that there would be an ample attic for his painting. And suddenly he found he could paint like his hero. His paintings are not copies of Picasso's; inspired by the Spanish genius, he paints objects which are broken down and then reassembled seemingly at random -- abstract works, if you will.""When I moved here I converted the attic, and that's my haven. I built the house in 2007 and in 2008 I got a present of an art-shop voucher. I bought paints and brushes and I found I could follow the Cubist style, and I've been painting ever since,"" Lamaat explains.He has even exhibited several times, showing his oils and acrylics at the RDS Art Fair, and during the Opera Festival in 2009 and 2010. He also has pieces on view at the Clyne Gallery in Temple Bar and is part of an art website run by vision 94 online gallery -- see www.wexfordpictureframing.ie or .com.According to Lamaat, the two careers work well together. ""I don't know if I feel happier painting. They're two separate entities. I enjoy my work at the hospital and then I detoxify myself, destress myself with the painting,"" he says. ""Painting is a good cut-off from work.""Lamaat also says his colleagues have been very supportive, turning up at his exhibitions and even buying his work. They'll get a further opportunity to buylater this month -- he's currently working on paintings for an exhibition at the Farmlane Gallery in Moycullen, Co Galway, starting on March 26. The attic studio is full of his preparations and therefore a tad messy.However, the rest of the house is pristine -- Lamaat is someone who likes everything ordered and in its place. Given his artistic nature, it comes as no surprise that his home is tastefully decorated. The public areas are floored in marble; the bedrooms are carpeted. ""I used to have wooden floors in the bedrooms of my last house, but I do like a little bit of comfort, and getting out of bed, it's nice to have a soft surface to stand on,"" he notes.The walls of all the rooms are white with one accent wall in each room. Most of the furniture is modern and there are lots of leather sofas, but any hard edges are softened with textures and textiles -- Lamaat is big on cushions and changes them to suit the seasons. Many of the curtain fabrics are silk, and came from Pakistan.Each room has interesting pieces from around the world; there are paintings by Lamaat's sister in Pakistan and lots of buddhas brought back from the east. There are also pieces from South Africa; a close friend, Patrick Meehan, goes to work for the Niall Mellon Township Trust every year for a week and always brings back a wall hanging, mask or some other artwork.Lamaat likes to have friends around to the house -- because he lives in the country he has four en suite bedrooms so that they can stay overnight. Dinner parties are his forte, so, naturally, a good kitchen was a priority. Patrick actually designed the kitchen, which is fitted with black high-gloss units finished with brushed stainless steel and covered with sillstone worktops. There are some particularly clever details in the design -- for example, the dishwasher is placed at a higher level than normal so that the person filling it doesn't have to bend. It, like all the other appliances, is by Neff. The funky Norm 69 light in the kitchen is retro in style.While he did a lot of research to get just the right thing for all the rooms, he found much of what he wanted in chain stores: the trio of lamps over the dining table is from Ikea. And, when he can't find what he wants, he often designs it himself. The Japanese-style coffee tables as well as the matching sideboards were designed by Lamaat and made by the company who fitted he kitchen.As well as the dining area, there are two other reception rooms -- the area Lamaat calls his media area, which has music, a television and computers; and secondly, the more formal area.Unusually for an Irish house, the entrance hall is enormous, almost a room in itself. Apparently it's a Pakistani thing. ""Hallways in Pakistan are bigger. I think the hallway is the most used space so I wanted it to be particularly nice.""Of course, it is also perfect for hanging pictures -- both Picasso's and Lamaat's.LWord count: 1570Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

She asserts that Jacqueline had a special role in anaesthetising and making happy the convulsive Picasso at the end of his life. She called him 'Monseigneur', 'Maitre' and 'Le Soleil'; he called her 'Mummy'; she got his teeth fixed and nursed his gall bladder and allowed his stinking goat to roam the ground floor of their house in Mougins. She was not much interested in sex - 'I have had to give up f***ing and smoking since I turned 90,' Picasso complained to the photographer Brassai, 'but I still think about them' - but theirs was otherwise an ideal marriage, and Picasso was a mile from a monster, Dupont coos. He was just a restless genius whom Jacqueline knew how to handle when the other women didn't. Ooh la la.'I'll see if the Maitre can receive you,' [Marina Picasso] remembers the elderly Italian concierge telling her and her father on one visit. After an 'endless' wait outside a locked gate, he reappeared. 'The Maitre can't see you today. Mme Jacqueline has asked me to tell you that he's working.' Marina's terse com-menwas: 'Even he's not fooled. He's ashamed.' The only point beyond dispute is that from 1953 Jacqueline Roque, a pottery sales lady in Vallauris, acted out with Picasso the role of Catherine Parr, sixth wife of Henry VIII. She soothed, stabilised and calmed down this lifetime seducer, as last wives do, whispering to him, 'Oh, [Pablo Picasso], you give them roses and they give you thorns,' and similar guff. In their time together at Chateau de Vauvenargues near Aix en Provence, at the Villa la Californie and at the hill farm of Notre Dame de Vie at Mougins above Cannes, Jacqueline changed into something softer, more sensuous and housewifely than the long-necked, sharp-nosed, ponytailed beauty of the 1954 portrait in the Musee Picasso. She also became, as Marina tells it, vastly manipulative.There is common ground between Marina and Mlle Dupont that [Pablito] had a very rough time. Both agree that he was treated with contempt by Picasso. In 1955, awestruck by his grandfather, he turned up, aged seven, with his younger sister at the Chateau de Vauvenargues and was told to get out and get lost. He dissolved into a lifetime's tears, as did Marina. It was the first of many humiliations Pablito received. When he appeared at Picasso's door in Mougins, he was routinely handed messages that Monseigneur was sleeping or working or eating. When he was rarely let in, he might be asked, 'How's school?' or 'Are you going away on holiday?' After this, Jacqueline would say, 'It's time to go. Pablo needs to be alone. You've made him tired.' Marina appears to have no problem with the accuracy of this. In her own memoirs in 2003 and 2007, she calls Picasso a monster, a tyrant, an egotist and a dark shadow on the lives of those around him, and claims he never showed Pablito 'the smallest affection'. He treated Pablito, she says, with 'sadism' and 'indifference'. But so, too, did Jacqueline. Marina writes in Picasso, My Grandfather that as news of Picasso's death reached the family, Pablito rushed to Mougins and rang the bell. No answer. Pablito kept ringing.

In June she issued her fourth writ against Pepita Dupont, a Paris Match journalist and author whose own special passion in life is 'justice' for Picasso's second and last wife, Jacqueline Roque. Jacqueline has been utterly defamed and insulted by the Picasso grandchildren and by his other women, Pepita Dupont believes. She has written a bestseller to say so.The defamation of poor Jacqueline, who shot herself in 1986, is along the lines of Private Eye's nickname for the youthful Mrs Rupert Murdoch, 38 years younger than her husband: Wendi Oldmansnuffsitigetthelot. Dupont's targets on behalf of Jacqueline thus include not just Marina but half a dozen biographers who portray her as a Trojan Horse shoved into Picasso's life in his seventies to grab the pictures and the loot.Pepita Dupont met Jacqueline in 1982, four years before she killed herself, and takes a predictable line. She asserts that Jacqueline had a special role in anaesthetising and making happy the convulsive Picasso at the end of his life. She called him 'Monseigneur', 'Maitre' and 'Le Soleil'; he called her 'Mummy'; she got his teeth fixed and nursed his gall bladder and allowed his stinking goat to roam the ground floor of their house in Mougins. She was not much interested in sex - 'I have had to give up f***ing and smoking since I turned 90,' Picasso complained to the photographer Brassai, 'but I still think about them' - but theirs was otherwise an ideal marriage, and Picasso was a mile from a monster, Dupont coos. He was just a restless genius whom Jacqueline knew how to handle when the other women didn't. Ooh la la.These claims affront the amour-propre of the Picasso clan, who not only know something different about the great man's vices but remember Jacqueline with hatred for barring the door to them. Thanks to her, Picasso could only be met by appointment between 1955 and 1973 (when his heart finally stopped), not just by friends and grovellers but by his family. Guards on the gate with snarling Afghan hounds held them at bay.'I'll see if the Maitre can receive you,' Marina remembers the elderly Italian concierge telling her and her father on one visit. After an 'endless' wait outside a locked gate, he reappeared. 'The Maitre can't see you today. Mme Jacqueline has asked me to tell you that he's working.'

She also became, as Marina tells it, vastly manipulative.Marina asserts against Dupont that the holy Jacqueline was the cause of universal grief. What has affronted her specifically, since you might wonder how any of the above is of the smallest interest to a French judge, is a claim by Mlle Dupont in her modestly titled work The Truth about Jacqueline and Pablo Picasso (published by Le Cherche Midi in Paris but available in English) that Marina's older brother Pablito burgled his grandfather's house to steal paintings while sky-high on drugs.Marina, who clearly loved Pablito dearly, calls this defamation. It's not clear whether she is alleging no burglary or no drugs, and even less clear who is being defamed, since Pablito has been dead for 36 years and isTHE PICASSO WOMEN - The present Paris quarrels descend from the artist's first wife, the Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova. Picasso married her in 1918. By her he had one son, Paulo, who died in 1975. Paulo Picasso gave his father three grandchildren. From his first marriage came Marina, now 58, Picasso's only legitimate living heir, and Pablito, who died in 1973, three months after swallowing bleach. From Paulo's second marriage came Bernard, now aged 50.- Olga and Picasso had separated by 1928.When Olga died in 1955, Picasso gallantly offered his hand in marriage to the mistress for whom he gave her up, Marie-Therese Walter. Marie-Therese, Picasso's lover from 1929 to 1938, by all accounts a generous lady, thanked him but refused. She bore him a child, Maya, in 1935. She hanged herself in 1977 in Juan Les Pins. In 1962, Maya had a son, Olivier, who wrote an idolising biography of Picasso.- The mistress-in-residence from 1936 to 1944 was Dora Maar, a photographer who briefly cohabited with Marie-Therese and got into a fist fight with her in 1938. She insisted to Picasso that 'one or other of us has got to go', but Picasso refused to choose between them and professed satisfaction with the situation. Marie-Therese exited, Dora won. She refused Picasso children but, being an expert black marketeer during the Second World War, kept him supplied with outstanding food and wine. Picasso left her in 1944 and she died in 1997.- Arriving circa 1943, surviving to 1954, was the art student Francoise Gilot, the only mistress to walk out on Picasso. She later expressed hatred, contempt and loathing of Picasso in a candid autobiography that the artist sought to suppress, but bore him two children, Claude, 62, and Paloma, 60. Gilot now lives between New York and Paris.- Other ladies of extreme youth, such as the Bardotesque Sylvette Jellinek and Genevieve Laporte, floated through Picasso's portraits and his life in the early 1950s, following the fashion of old men pursuing young blondes.- The girl with staying power proved to be Jacqueline Roque, a pottery sales lady in Vallauris, 45 years younger than the lecherous Picasso. She was introduced to him in 1953 by a financially interested friend who saw her as a deathbed romance. Jacqueline surfaced in his portraits from 1954: Picasso made over 400 of her. Like Dora, she gave him no children but married him in Vallauris on 2 March 1961. She magnificently stayed the course to the end and became the infinitely rich owner of a vast number of his paintings and artworks. Most of them went to the nation (the Musee Picasso in Paris) after she shot herself in 1986.beyond the reach of libel. And it is possible Marina is stronger on passion than on legal judgment, since in two of her immense previous actions against Dupont she won the gigantic damages of EUR 1 in each case. But she is angry, sans aucun doute.We won't know the detail until a judge rules in September whether the dead can claim damages. But Marina's problem with Pablito and Pepita Dupont centres on why Pablito swallowed a bottle of bleach four days after Picasso died in 1973 and thus ended his misery. La Dupont says, broadly, that he was a multiple drug addict and depressive who gave up for those reasons, but adds that he killed himself also from his undoubted hatred of Picasso. Marina says, au contraire, he killed himself from his undoubted hatred of Jacqueline. She was his wicked step-motherPicasso, 'a genius without mercy', was 'in thrall' to her.There is common ground between Marina and Mlle Dupont that Pablito had a very rough time. Both agree that he was treated with contempt by Picasso. In 1955, awestruck by his grandfather, he turned up, aged seven, with his younger sister at the Chateau de Vauvenargues and was told to get out and get lost.

When he was rarely let in, he might be asked, 'How's school?' or 'Are you going away on holiday?' After this, Jacqueline would say, 'It's time to go. Pablo needs to be alone. You've made him tired.' Marina appears to have no problem with the accuracy of this. In her own memoirs in 2003 and 2007, she calls Picasso a monster, a tyrant, an egotist and a dark shadow on the lives of those around him, and claims he never showed Pablito 'the smallest affection'. He treated Pablito, she says, with 'sadism' and 'indifference'. But so, too, did Jacqueline. Marina writes in Picasso, My Grandfather that as news of Picasso's death reached the family, Pablito rushed to Mougins and rang the bell. No answer. Pablito kept ringing. A guard appeared with the Afghan hounds .'Go away!' he shouted. 'You can't come in. I have orders from Mme Picasso.' Pablito insisted on his wish to say goodbye.The warder turned nasty. 'Clear off!' he shouted. 'Get out of sight or I'll release the dogs!' With that, Marina narrates, he rushed out and threw Pablito's moped in a ditch.There was one final humiliation for Pablito: what caused him to drink the bleach was the ban imposed on Marina and her brother from attending Picasso's funeral.'Who barred us other than Jacqueline?' asks Marina. For Pablito, it was a rejection too far; without it, he might still be with us. He took the bleach and died in anguish three months later. But Dupont's answer differs. It was not Jacqueline but Picasso who kept the grandchildren from his funeral. He had, she says, given instructions long beforehand.Pepita Dupont attracts writs as skilfully as she attracts publicity. She has provoked the wrath not just of Marina but of Jacqueline's daughter Catherine by her previous marriage to the engineer Andre Hutin. Catherine Hutin-Blay objects to 20 passages in The Truth about Jacqueline and Pablo Picasso but notably a suggestion by Dupont that she ignored her mother's wish that 61 Picassos be presented after her death to Spain. Somehow they stayed in France. Naturally she, too, is suing for breach of privacy.Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santisima Trinidad Clito Ruiz y Picasso is a case for Dr Freud. He does not emerge well from the memories of his descend- ants. His long shadow, his immense narcissism, caused Pablito to drink the hemlock, Jacqueline to blow her brains out, his pretty mistress Marie-Therese Walter to hang herself and Marina to spend 14 years in therapy, in which last misery Picasso was, according to Marina, totally uninterested. In 21st-century analysis and parlance, Picasso was a psychopath.'His life,' declares Marina, 'didn't centre around Pablito, or me, my father, my mother, my grandmother Olga, or the women whose deaths he brought about. There was only one thing that mattered to him: painting. In order to create, he had to destroy everything that got in the way of his creation. He had also to destroy us... we were merely the fallout from his art.' This is not quite right. There were other things that mattered to Picasso quite as much as painting. One was sex, the other money, as his snarl-ups with his dealers, notably Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, make clear.Picasso should have married a lawyer because much of his time when not outpouring sex at the easel was spent agonising over the fate of his money after death. It paralysed him. French law prohibited 'children in adultery' from inheriting until 1972, a severe case of the sins of the father being visited on the children.The moment the barrier lifted, there began a desperate scramble among the Picasso mistresses and grandchildren to get themselves legitimised by Paris lawyers. Picasso helped by dying in the middle of it all in June 1973 - as you guessed, intestate. His principal bequest was a lawyer's paradise.The grandchildren took four years to sort it out. In the oh-we-are-so-happy account of the Picasso family by the starry-eyed Olivier (grandson by Marie-Therese), Picasso: the Real Family Story, it was all peaches and cream and a cause for congratulations by 1977.Not quite. Claude, son of Picasso and the very clever Francoise Gilot, saw trouble coming early and went to the Paris courts in 1969 for orders on distributing the Picasso estate. 'Just as if I'm dead already,' Picasso said to Jacqueline as the world concluded that he was finally ready to step into his grave. He had four years to go, on every day of which he made wildly erotic drawings. 'We must show new work or Claude will persuade them that I am dead or paralysed,' he asserted to Jacqueline. The result was a vast exhibition of bullfighters and matadors at the Palais des Papes at Avignon in 1970, a memory for Picasso admirers comparable as a legend to Damien Hirst's Freeze show in 1988.When the lawyers and notably the French taxman moved in on the Picasso estate after his death in 1973, at the front of the family queue was Paulo, the only child of the first marriage to Olga. But Paulo died in 1975 after a short and vivid spending spree on a Jaguar, a Daimler, a Bentley, several Rolls-Royces, a Range Rover and numerous Mercedes. Marina, his daughter, took his place and the largest share of the inheritance. She aimed for three-quarters of the estate but lost. She claimed Jacqueline had stashed pictures away but failed to prove it (and was herself convicted of illegal export in 1996). She tried to get all of Picasso's illegitimate children confined to half-shares, and the mistresses excluded, but failed. They all got themselves legitimised before settlement in 1976.Of the Pounds 92 million estate, Jacqueline received approximately 30 per cent, Marina and Bernard (her half-brother, Paulo's son) 20 per cent each, and Maya, Claude and Paloma (Picasso's illegitimate children) ten per cent each. For all their quarrels, the Picasso children and grandchildren are happily still cashing in. They are an enlarged nuisance to Sotheby's and Christie's and to the London, New York and Paris. art trade for regularly selling inherited paintings but demanding high prices. A line in the London art trade is that what the family owns are the pictures Picasso couldn't sell. 'He got every penny for a picture he could lay hands on in his lifetime,' comments a Chelsea dealer. In other words, the family possessions aren't that brilliant and Sotheby's and Christie's have failed to sell a number of them .Nevertheless, the descendants also cash in magnificently from the EU tax called droit de suite, or 'right of followers' - in this case, their right to claim up to four per cent on every sale within Europe of an artwork created in the last 70 years: Pounds 5 million at auction? The family gets Pounds 250,000. There are more than 200 sales a year at auction of Picasso's paintings and drawings. Galleries in London and Paris. do as many.Whatever the grief, tragedy, vulnerability and shattered lives of Maya, Francoise, Marina, Claude, Paloma and Olivier, they have this comfort to keep them warm on dark nights and long days in court, while they continue to fight over their tragic and wonderful legacy.beyond the reach of libel.

The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up."" It's a struggle that seems to go with the territory and which acclaimed local artist Nicola Russell almost succumbed to.As a young, struggling artist making no money, Nicola, now 47, was at one point forced to give up her painting to try and make a living in the ""real world"".Thankfully after just a year of doing odd jobs she was drawn back to the easel and has since built up an international reputation for her work, which has been praised by royalty and presidents.Her journey has been unconventional, driven by her passion rather than any desire to make her fortune, an approach that has earned her recognition for a series of high-profile paintings.A battle with breast cancer in 2007 reinforced for her the importance of enjoying life and persuaded her to fulfil a lifetime's ambition of doing a large-scale painting.One of her favourite subjects is horses and in spring 2009 she launched a campaign called The Big Horse Project with the Irish Field, Horse Racing Ireland and The Irish Times to find the nation's favourite race horse of the last 25 years.Horse lovers voted in their thousands and with no commission and taking a year and a half to complete, she produced a massive 10ft by 13ft canvas of Ireland's favourite racehorse -- Istabraq.The magnificent portrait was finally unveiled on May 3 this year in the parade ring at the Punchestown Irish National Hunt Festival by Istabraq's famous owner JP McManus, trainer Aidan O'Brien and jockey Charlie Swan.Now, the huge canvas has just gone on public display at Dublin Airport.It's the latest high in an eventful career that saw Nicola earn early acclaim as an artist when commissioned to paint a portrait of Bill Clinton to commemorate his visit to Belfast. It was unveiled in a fanfare of publicity by Senator George Mitchell.In 1998 she met the Queen when she was invited to present her with her painting Wild Irish Colt at a reception for the arts at Windsor Castle.A year later there was more press attention when she presented Mo Mowlam with a portrait and in the same year she became the first artist to exhibit in the windows of Brown Thomas in Dublin.But it could all have been so different as, at the age of 30, a disheartened Nicola reluctantly decided that she could not longer sustain her art as a way of supporting herself and gave it up in search of a more secure income.She recalls those early years after she graduated from Winchester School of Art: ""You come out of college in your early 20s burning with enthusiasm and convinced you are going to be the next Picasso.""You work your way through the system applying for Arts Council grants and trying to get exhibitions in public galleries because that's what you are trained to do.""Your enthusiasm carries you through even though you are making no money and pretty much starving in the garret.""You are living this life as an artist, all quite bohemian and fun and then reality hits and you have to start to think about the future and how you are going to survive.""It's at that point that a lot of artists give up and go into teaching or other professions.""I knew I needed to make money and so I tried training in IT, I did window dressing and various other jobs for a year.""Nicola grew up in Portadown but now lives in Belfast, where she has her own studio and gallery in Queen Street.Her dad George is a retired vet and her mum Jill ran The Irish Times office in Belfast. She has one brother, Richard, who lives in California, and a sister, Gail, who lives in Newquay.Although not married, her partner of eight years, Kenny Body, works alongside her as director of her studio.As well as portraits and horses, Nicola is well known for beautiful paintings of flowers, which are what drew her back to her passion after her year of trying to pursue a career outside of her art.She explains: ""I had this impulse to paint the flowers in my mother's garden, it was like an impulse you get to go for a walk or have dinner, and I couldn't ignore it.""At first I resisted because there was no cerebral content in them but because of the love of what I was seeing I decided to do it.""I did several and people either wanted to buy them or told me I should try and sell them so I did an exhibition and they sold out.""This encouraged Nicola to set up her first studio, which she opened in the Farset Enterprise Centre on the Springfield Road in Belfast.She was 33 and applied for a LEDU start-up course to learn about business and also decided to join the Belfast Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses.""I immersed myself in and surrounded myself with business people as I really liked their work ethic and I learnt so much from them.""It was through her business contacts that she was commissioned to do the portrait of President Bill Clinton, a painting that catapulted her as an artist into the public eye.After two years in Belfast she moved to a new studio in Holywood where she decided to do a portrait of Mo Mowlam, again with no financial gain but purely out of admiration for the then Secretary of State.She recalls: ""I admired her enormously and she was getting quite a lot of criticism at the time from politicians for going into prison to talk to paramilitaries.""I felt very strongly that she had put her career on the line and shown incredible courage and I was aggrieved that she was not being acknowledged for that.""I did the portrait and she came to the gallery in Holywood and there was a massive turnout.""At the time she was terminally ill but hadn't told anyone. She seemed to love it and I was really glad that I had done it.""Later, I was told by someone who had been at her house that she had it hanging over her mantelpiece, which made me realise that she really must have liked it.""In November 2007, Nicola completed a portrait of Baroness May Blood MBE which was also unveiled by Senator George Mitchell, Chancellor of Queen's and which now hangs in the University's Great Hall.In the same year her world was rocked when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.The news was all the more shocking because she had no lump and her symptoms were of the kind not normally associated with breast cancer.She said: ""I always thought breast cancer was detected by a lump. I had noticed that my nipple appeared to have flattened and wasn't really concerned about it; I just thought it was maybe down to my age and my body shape changing.""It then became sore and I developed a bit of a rash so I went to the doctor; it wasn't my usual GP and she told me that I had an infection and gave me antibiotics.""It didn't clear up and I went back and pretty much insisted that I needed to see someone about it, although I still didn't think for one minute it was cancer.""A week later she was in the Ulster Hospital where a biopsy was carried out and results delivered that same day revealed a cancerous tumour.Nicola had to have her breast removed and then received the strongest course of chemotherapy available, followed by radiotherapy.During her illness she walked every day and it was during her walks that she became acutely aware of the sound of the birds around her.This led to her doing a series of paintings on endangered birds and last month she donated a series of spectacular prints of the Yellow Hammer to raise funds for the Ulster Cancer Foundation and Friends of the Cancer Centre.She says: ""The Yellow Hammer is so sweet and he just made me laugh when I looked at him and he summed up how I was feeling -- so grateful to be alive and able to appreciate what was around me.""When I was ill, I received counselling from Dorothy Smallwood of the Ulster Cancer Foundation, who sadly passed away from cancer last August.""She helped me so much. You can cope with the physical stuff but the emotional upset is harder to deal with.""I wanted to do something to ensure that other people can benefit from the service and money raised from the prints will go towards helping to fund the counselling service.""Nicola's Yellow Hammer prints were launched at a special event in the Ulster Museum last month, hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Abercorn and sponsored by Cleaver, Fulton and Rankin.Nicola adds: ""When you face something like cancer, it changes you. I wake up happy every day because I have that sense of being alive. You become very grateful for what you have and you learn not to waste time worrying.""To buy a print and support the Ulster Cancer Foundation contact Maeve Fox, tel: 028 9066 3281 or email maevefox@ulstercancer.org.IllustrationCaption: SURE BET: Nicola, JP McManus, Charlie Swan and Aidan O'Brien with the Istabraq canvasCAMPAIGN: Nicola and The Duke and Duchess of Abercorn with her Yellow Hammer prints that are raising funds for the Ulster Cancer FoundationUNVEILING: George Mitchell and Baroness Mary Blood at Queen'sADMIRER: mo loved the portrait (left) that Nicola painted for hersupport: Nicola and the QueenHIGH PROFILE: Nicola with Bill Clinton and (left) her portraitWord count: 1646Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The woman on the screen is clearly Spanish, maybe at a bullfight. At any rate, she is wearing a veil, a comb and an arch expression, and she's smoking. She folds her lipsticked mouth into a moue, bats her eyelids, flicks a lighted match at the camera. Then it strikes you where you've seen this vamp before: that she is Pablo Picasso, and that he's dressed in the role of Carmen.There may be more unlikely drag artistes than Picasso, though few spring easily to mind. Macho is a Spanish word meaning male or virile, and Picasso - cradle-snatching, bullfighting, eternally priapic Pablo - was the living embodiment of both. Yet here he is, not just in a veil but bridling and pouting, in a short film by Man Ray called La Garoupe (1937). The movie takes you aback, though by the time you reach it your ideas about Picasso may already have changed.The film is the last work in a show called Picasso - Carmen, which traces the artist's interest in the titular cigar girl. In Madrid in 1898, long before he went to Paris, Picasso produced a sketch called Carmen. Its subject was to recur in his work, directly and indirectly, for the next 70 years, culminating in a series of illustrations to Merimee's novella made in the 1960s.This seems an unlikely f ixation for a man who led his life like a character from Hemingway, and yet, as you walk through this show, Picasso's love for the gypsy seems inevitable. Most obviously, her story brings together the two stars in his firmament, women and bulls. Picasso's reclaiming of Carmen also has a national flavour. For Merimee and Bizet (and particularly for Picasso's hero, Manet), ""Spanish"" was a synonym for ""exotic"". Taking Carmen back from the French - repossessing her mantillas, her camp, her ineffably Spanish kitsch - counts as something in the way of justice for a Spaniard working in Paris.More surprising is what this kitsch meant to Picasso. As I've said, he was the soul of machismo, and yet objects from his archive hint at something more equivocal. The show opens with Picasso's collection of postcards of toreadors and maja - portraits of Francisco Madrid, girlish in powder blue and sequins; of a dancer called ""La Preciosilla"", her gaze stronger than the toreador's, more manly. This gender-bending continues with a series of erotic cards in which male bullfighters with female genitals wave capes at penises on legs. Hemingway was never like this, and nor, until now, was Picasso.Aptly, the first work in Picasso - Carmen is not by Picasso but by Manet, his cod-Hispanic Angelina. It's tempting to see the role played by Carmen in Picasso's oeuvre as roughly that of Olympe in Manet's. Both women, sexually free-wheeling, challenge the stereotype of masculine dominance which both men seem to back up.Once you spot this self-subversion in Picasso's work, you see it everywhere: in the Carmen-esque mantilla worn by Dora Maar in a 1937 cliche-verre; in the extraordinary Corrida: la mort de la femme torero (1933), where the implied femininity of toreadors is made actual. The gender of the actors in Picasso's pictures shift about. Sometimes his horses are mares, sometimes stallions; Europa is raped by a bull, but the bull-man in The Vanquished Minotaur is un-manned by a woman. The womanliness of Francisco Madrid has its equal in the Michelangelesque shoulders of Picasso's Standing Female Nude (1906- 7), in the columnar neck of his 1903 Head of a Woman. Even Picasso's marriage is open to gender reassignment, his 1955 photograph in the guise of a torero being matched by one of his second wife, Jacqueline, in identical costume. And then, of course, there is La Garoupe.What does all of this add up to? One of the clever things about this show is that it makes no great claims for itself. There is little in the way of signage, less of polemic in its wonderfully camp catalogue. There are no hints at funny goings-on in Picasso's bedroom, nor of unrealised desires in his life. Picasso - Carmen is, as the French say, a jeu d'esprit, as witty in its way as its subject's art.It is also something more than that. It has certainly changed the way I think about Picasso, and is likely to change the way you do.To 24 June (00 33 1 42 71 70 84, www.musee-picasso.fr)Word count: 767Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

As they have proved in spectacular fashion before, when Gagosian teams with Mr. Richardson, Picasso's foremost biographer, they can elicit quality loans. This joint venture is no different. The wall of drawings from 1908-10, on the left as you walk in, is mostly borrowed from private collections. Picasso's cubist studies -- in which he methodically breaks down the continuous human figure, including the eyes and ears, and forges the parts into stronger, baser elements -- are often more enjoyable to behold than the finished result. Cubism was a way to replicate and remake the appearance of all things, as was photography. Mr. Richardson proposes that the automatic abstracting found in black-and-white printing aided in Picasso's and Braque's visual revolution. To back up the argument, the catalog reproduces a 1982 article from the Art Bulletin by Paul Hayes Tucker, then professor of art history at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, in which he suggests that a 1909 group of photographs taken by Picasso in Spain may stand behind the cubist landscapes he painted that summer in Horta de Ebro. Two paintings cited by Mr. Tucker -- one from the Museum of Modern Art, one from the Denver Art Museum -- hang here next to two of those photographs. Viewers can decide whether the rooftops going every which way and the canted perspective in the monochrome prints shaped the tightly interlocking planes in the brown-green-gray painting ""Le Reservoir."" Mr. Tucker was careful not to overstate the impact of Picasso's photography on the work, concluding that ""all of this, of course, remains somewhat speculative; there were many other influences that Picasso synthesized that summer."" A vitrine nearby features his snapshots of his paintings from this period. The fact that as a young artist he wanted to document his work in photographs is more telling than the photographs themselves, which are small and in many cases faded. Picasso developed a mania to date everything he did, and the camera aided in the chronicling of his legend. As he told the photographer Brassai in the 1960s -- in words that sanctioned the attention of biographers like Mr. Richardson -- ""it's not enough to know an artist's works. One must also know when he made them, why, how, under what circumstances."" In the photographs Picasso took and the even greater number taken of him, the show also traces his active social life, as well as his marital, and extramarital, relationships. There are smiling portraits of his first wife, the ballerina Olga Khokhlova, from 1917, as well as less happy ones done a few years later. Sergei Diaghilev, Leonide Massine, Natalia Goncharova and Jean Cocteau have cameo roles in snapshots of larky excursions in Paris, Rome, Barcelona and Monte Carlo. Playing on four monitors in the center of the room are loops of home movies from the 1930s (one taken by Man Ray) that capture Picasso with friends on vacation in the south of France. Other shorter clips show him as doting father, with his son Paul, and as owner of a Great Pyrenees, a dog almost bigger than he is. The series of photographs Picasso made in 1931 at the Chateau de Boisgeloup (on the back wall at Gagosian) had a more serious purpose: He wanted to catalog the constant alterations he was making to the clay sculptures based on his mistress Marie-Therese Walter. For the first time, he seems careful about lighting and angles. In a photograph of Olga posed outside his studio, where the bust of Walter is visible behind her, he may even be leaving clues for posterity -- and making a cruel joke -- about where his true feelings lay. (When Brassai's photographs of these phallic sculptures were published in the surrealist magazine Minotaure, in 1933, they created a sensation.) Picasso also at times relied on photographic images as source material for paintings. Jean Painleve's underwater film documentaries from the late 1920s were beloved by the surrealists, and Mr. Richardson suggests a connection between one of them, about an octopus, and ""Femme nue couchee,"" a 1932 portrait of Walter with arms like tentacles. The 357 photographic reproductions of archaic Greek sculpture in Christian Zervos's 1934 book ""L'art en Grece"" likely inspired Picasso's sculptures and drawings around the same time. But beyond these examples, there isn't much here to back up the statement in the press release that Picasso used photography as ""an integral part of his studio practice."" He didn't pick up a camera to explore its unique potential for picture-making, as did, say, Degas and Brancusi. Nor was he curious how it might serve to open a door to the uncanny, an obsession of his lover Dora Maar and of Man Ray. The largest part of the show, fascinating in its own right, documents how Picasso exploited photographers -- and they him -- in creating the myth of the protean genius with the bald head and burning gaze. A celebrity before he was 30, he sustained that status to the end of his life and beyond, thanks in no small part to photography and film. Picasso had his portrait taken more often than any other 20th-century artist (except probably Andy Warhol) and many of those who helped to burnish his image -- Brassai, Lucien Clergue, Arnold Newman, Edward Quinn, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, Man Ray, Andre Villers -- are included here. Filmmakers played their part, too. In 1949, two years before Jackson Pollock did a painting on a sheet of glass for Hans Namuth's camera, Picasso drew with a light stick for Gjon Mili and Life magazine. Bare-chested, wielding his pen like a sword, the middle-aged artist is like an athlete who doesn't imagine that he might ever make a mistake. One feels the swaggering self-confidence that intoxicated so many who entered his circle. Dora Maar's photographs of him from the mid-'30s (some only in the catalog) reveal a more inward-looking man and are more sensitive than any Picasso took of others. Perhaps because during their intense love affair she was using photography to explore surrealist effects, he didn't see a need to compete with her. Or perhaps he didn't think that a mechanical device could do much for his hand-generated art. Mr. Richardson says that the idea for ""Picasso and the Camera"" began with a work (found on the gallery's right wall) that he owns and that adorned the cover of the third volume of his biography. It is a pencil portrait of Picasso done in 1921 by his lover Valentine Hugo. When she photographed it in 1937 and presented it to him, he drew motifs from ""Guernica"" around his chin, like a beard. Such treatment does not indicate a high regard for photographs as objects. They were just another material to rework with his pen, much the same way that he cut up Andre Villers's prints with his scissors for their 1962 collaborative series, ""Diurnes."" It is hard not to conclude from this generous display that Picasso used the camera mainly to document his progress as a towering artist, and that the images he made with this slavish tool are more precious to art historians and biographers than they ever were to him. --- Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.

Dali introduced the younger Fuertes to Andre Breton, father of the surrealist movement. Mr. Fuertes met Picasso in France and delved into neo-cubism, mixing geometric shapes with bright colors. Several of his most well-known works involved the use of stunning shades of blue, which earned him the moniker ""Painter of Blue.""

Perhaps the master's most celebrated series of etchings, the suite, named after Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939), Picasso's early dealer and publisher, was purchased by a savvy NGC in 1957 and displayed to the public shortly thereafter. Individual prints and grouplets thereof have been exhibited since then, but never the complete set. The NGC rectifies the lacuna Friday when it presents all 100 prints in an exhibition running through Sept. 5. The suite, commissioned in 1930 by Vollard, who ""paid"" Picasso in paintings by C√©zanne and Renoir, was completed in 1937. However, printing the estimated 300 or so sets wasn't done until 1939, by which time Vollard was dead and the Second World War in full swing. It was only in the mid-1950s that the sets finally were distributed, the NGC being one of the few museums in the world to acquire the entire ensemble.Word count: 175Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Sourced from private owners, this selection of etchings, aquatints, lithographs and linocuts spans Picasso's graphic output in every medium and concentrates almost entirely on the figure, often with overt eroticism.From the Vollard Suite in 1933 are crisp line drawings in playful mood depicting sculptor and model, and compositions illumined by painterly washes of light and darkness when the sculptor morphs into the monstrous though gentle Minotaur. He contemplates the soft flesh of his sleeping lover, recognisably languid, supple Marie-Therese Walter, in the marvellous ""Minotaure caressant une dormeuse"": ""he is studying her, trying to read her thoughts . . . trying to decide whether she loves him because he's a monster,"" Picasso explained.The lithographs ""Les Deux Femmes Nues"", made in 1945-6 during Picasso's relationship with Francoise Gilot, are more cerebral, exploring how the form of a double portrait can evolve from intricate, traditional representation to a thoroughly cubist, abstracted image at the end of the series. Coloured linocuts of Gilot's successor Jacqueline Roque experiment similarly with flattened stylisation and extravagant 16th-century fancy dress: ""Portrait Stylise de Jacqueline"", ""La Dame a la Collerette (Portrait de Jacqueline a la Fraise)"". Most poignant is the ""347"" series (1968), dramatising impotence and women's power over men in comic old age narratives - ""Petit Vieux Flatte par la Celestine"", ""Grosse Prostituee et Mousquetaire"".

During these hibernating days, the frozen garden offers little color to cut and bring indoors. So when the time came to choose a piece of art to serve as this month's inspiration, I sought out something vivid, playful and mood-elevating. A number of factors conspired to lead me to ""The Red Armchair"" (1931), a painting by Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). I had recently seen an exhibit of his sculptures at New York's Museum of Modern Art, so he was on my mind. I'd also come across a white earthenware vessel, known as the Medusa vase, by ceramist Frances Palmer. The wriggly stripes she'd pinched into the clay and the looping handles recalled Picasso's work in general and specifically the face in this painting, a canvas that met my criteria for February-doldrums-banishing. Vessels are important. They should give you as much joy empty as full, and different styles serve different functions: Straight-sided shapes give flowers a vertical modern rigor; a form that nips and flares, like an ironstone pitcher, lets blooms fall horizontally for a looser, romantic look. From the flower market and a local deli I sourced a bold mix of purple anemones, yellow roses, red parrot tulips, orange kumquat cuttings with green leaves, deep plum ninebark and nandina foliage. I then grouped hues to reference the canvas's color blocking. The yellows and oranges on the painting's left were supplied by roses and kumquats. Anemones and ninebark evoke the upper right quadrant, and red tulips mimic the stripes. To give depth to the floral tableau, I tucked another of Ms. Palmer's vases, porcelain in sang de boeuf glaze, to the left and let a single red tulip drape over the rim. This spirited, intense mix of colors--some from blooms, some from citrus--successfully dispelled even the most ferocious February cabin fever.

The event in this case was the ongoing Vollard Suite show at the Instituto Cervantes in New Delhi, which has on display 100 prints by the Spanish artist, no he was not French, Pablo Picasso. They were created by Picasso, undoubtedly the Father of Contemporary Art, as copper etching plates for art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who gave Picasso his first solo exhibition at Vollard's gallery in Paris.Commissioned between 1930-37, the prints were categorised under different themes Picasso dealt with earlier. The Battle of Love (five images), Rembrandt (four images), The Sculptors Studio (46 images), The Minotaur and The Blind Minotaur (15 images) and lastly, three portraits of Vollard. There were to have been more, but Vollard, an art dealer and a publisher, died in a 1939 car accident. The etching plates went to one Henri Petiet and changed hands several times. The collection last belonged to an art dealer named Mrs Kahnweiller. So we were told by Alberto Manzano Martos, President of the Institute of Culture MAPFRE, who now own the lot.While showing us around the temperature controlled gallery at the Spanish Cultural Centre which is located on 48 Hanuman Road, Martos shared with us it was only the second time the exhibits had travelled from Spain. ""The first show outside was in Columbia."" He added that The Sculptor's Studio section was particularly interesting, ""because it revealed the sculptor's relationship with the model, parallelling Picasso's relations with his much younger lover, Marie-Therese. And also how he tried to transform his sculptural work to this other medium.""He then indicated that one of The Minotaur prints had a screaming, disfigured face in the background and we laughed wickedly at the misery of the jealous lover preserved for posterity, as he shared ""it was an irate Olga Kohklova."" Picasso was married Kohklova at the time of his affair with Marie-Therese. Martos also added that ""back in Spain, the etchings are not regularly open to the public being extremely sensitive to light. So, if they are exposed one day, then they are left for the next three or more in the dark.""For a short history on the copper etchings which Picasso had done in exchange for paintings by famous artists he wished to own, you might be interested to know the artist was then based in Paris, where he spent most of his life. And he was around 50 when he began to do them. He was also between the women in his life, as he constantly seemed to be. Much has been written about Picasso's various wive's and mistresses. They have also been remembered in film. The famous ones include model Ferdnande Oliver, Eva Grouel, Olga Kohklova, Marie Therese Walter, Dora Maar and Francois Gilot.In 1930, Picasso had begun to have affair with the Rubenesque 20-year-old Marie Therese, by whom he had a son. He was also spending time with Olga Kokhlova whom he had married in 1918. Eva Gouel was dead of tubercolosis and he was yet to begin another tempestuous relationship with Yugoslavia photographer Dora Maar whom he would meet in 1936.The Sculptor's Studio etchings mainly represent the period with Marie Theresa who inspired them and of whom he made plaster sculpture models. They seem to have been somewhat derived in treatment from the classical fable about sculptor-king Pygmalion who fell in love with a statue he made of the woman, Galatea. Similarly, The Minotaur series, which often represent the artist as the brutish Minotaur, also contain classical references that possibly resulted from trips Picasso made in his younger days to cities like Naples, Pompeii and Rome.His smaller series on Rembrandt is a tribute to the Dutch master who was himself a fine etcher. Hardcore art buffs will probably be interested in some of the techniques this innovator par excellence applied, like the 'sugar lift' which gave some of his etchings a deeper tone.Picasso usually began his work with a line etching, then adding both drypoint and aquatint for a light-dark effect. Incidentally each plates produced 313 prints, with Vollard or Picasso's watermark on 260 of them, on a paper known as Montval. They are in the possession of around five museums.A further 50 of the etchings were printed on paper about 2 inches in length and breadth. It appears that there are apparently three signed copies on parchment, but they are not available to the public.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Pioneer.

The exhibition cum sale, of course, seemed worth it for some collectors, artists and art dealers as 10 of the 40 Picasso-signed knick-knacks (mostly prints and ceramics) were picked up. The exhibition was curated by London's Grosvenor Gallery, the gallery's trading partner. Conor Macklin, the representative from Grosvenor, said that though he usually disassociated himself from reproductions, ""Picasso's influence as a printmaker was immense."" Picasso made more than 1,000 prints including etchings, engravings, drypoints, woodcuts, lithographs and lino cuts and almost single-handedly returned printmaking's centre to France. This sale, worth Rs 9 crore, will be on till March 2 and the month-long exhibition will include nine drawings, 11 lithographs, seven etchings, four aquatints, two linocuts, two round dish prints and a set of eight ceramic plates. While the National Museum did hold an impressive Picasso exhibition in 2002, where 120-odd works were displayed, this is the first time that a private gallery has brought an important European master. That too, for sale. Present from the Capital's artist fraternity were Gopi Gajwani, Satish Gujral with wife Kiran, Arpita and Paramjit Singh, A Ramachandran as well as sculptor K S Radhakrishnan. Also seen browsing were artist Blanca Peralta, fashionista Nainika Karan, Palette Art Gallery's Rohit Gandhi and former diplomat Bhaichand Patel.

He is on a lecture circuit and speaking to children where he can about his books, The Boy Who Bit Picasso and the soon-to-be released Miro's Magic Animals.Penrose, who wrote a children's book about the time he bit Picasso as a youngster, entertained kids at Lake Rotoiti School with stories about growing up with famous artists for friends.He was pleased to have had the opportunity to visit the school yesterday to share some of the stories from his books.""I think it is the most delightful school I have been to in the world,"" he said.""Such a wonderful strength and vision.""Penrose has many stories about his time spent with Picasso including tales of Picasso's many pet animals and the time Penrose did indeed bite the famous artist on the arm during a pretend bull fighting game, after which Picasso bit him right back.He said Miro was a quiet and friendly man who loved painting animals and they had visited London Zoo together.Growing up among famous artists was a great influence on the young Penrose - it encouraged him to remain curious and look for the deeper meaning within images and objects, he said.""I think if I came away with anything it was a kind of automatic reaction to always try and look beneath the surface of things to see what else was going on,"" Penrose said.""Why does it interest Picasso or Miro or whoever else, to make this thing that he did. What was he communicating to us?""That curiosity is evident in his two children's books, which are both filled with paintings, drawings and photographs that tell the stories and adventures he shared with the famous artists. It is that curious spirit that he encourages in children, his books introduce art and adult subjects in a way they can understand.""The trick is, I think, if you can just get the children's attention by appealing to them on a child's level then the art just goes in naturally and they just take to it,"" he said.""[Art] is readily understandable by children, I think they have an easier time with it than adults.""He has another two books in the pipeline, Molly The Cat Who Loved Opera, based on a true story about a stray cat who called Glyndebourne Opera house home and My Surrealist Mum, that describes living in a home frequented by different artists. The house in which he grew up, Farley Farm in East Sussex is now a museum and Penrose has been dedicated to curating his mother's photographic work and taking it to exhibitions around the world.One of those exhibitions brought him to New Zealand in 1995 and he hopes to bring another exhibition of his mother's down under in 2018.""It was before Lee Miller had reached the elevation that she has now yet she was still very well received and accepted here in this country which was rather touching,"" he said.As a child, he recalls being drawn to photographs of the New Zealand landscape, it became an ambition to travel here, one that was fulfilled in his 20s when he travelled throughout the country in the early 1970s, spending some time working in Auckland.""I had always been drawn to the photographs of New Zealand as a youngster. The mountains and wild, wild beaches and things like that made me think as a kid, that [New Zealand] would be a wonderful place ... that certainly stayed with me and the ambition has never been disappointed.""Credit: SAMANTHA GEEIllustrationCaption: Antony Penrose, author of The Boy Who Bit Picasso.

That may be the wrong question to ask about the Spaniard who changed the course of 20th century art but in the age of cancel culture it‚Äôs a question that has been posed, appropriately or not. In the era of #MeToo his apparent chauvinism has been highlighted and even harped on by some. But, as they say in the movies, it‚Äôs complicated. Picasso, who died in 1973 aged 91, had many relationships, some of them torrid and troubled and he even admitted to one mistress that he found it hard to relate to women other than as ‚Äúgoddesses or doormats‚Äù. His personality, relationships and artistic legacy will be discussed in the public program that is part of National Gallery of Victoria‚Äôs landmark exhibition The Picasso Century at the NGV International until October 9. The man who created and curated the show, Didier Ottinger, deputy director of the Musee national d‚Äôart moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris, says the exhibition is, among other things, ‚Äúan answer to many of the criticisms now being addressed about Picasso‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are some very fierce feminists who have called him a misogynist and violent and so on,‚Äù Ottinger says during a whirlwind tour of the exhibition. ‚ÄúBut what you will discover in this show is that he was very sensitive, emotional and you just look at his work and you can see that. It‚Äôs not the work of an aggressive man. He is passionate, yes, and of course he was macho ‚Ä¶ he was from the south of Spain. If you really want to understand his feelings just listen to flamenco music. ‚ÄúI hope this exhibition will show who Picasso really was and that might calm things down a bit.‚Äù It will also excite people too because it is an extraordinary cavalcade of 20th century art charting the amazing career of Picasso in dialogue with many artists, poets and intellectuals with whom he interacted in his adopted city of Paris including Guillaume Apollinaire, Georges Braque, Salvador Dali and Gertrude Stein. Developed exclusively for the NGV by the Centre Pompidou and the Musee national Picasso-Paris, the exhibition features 80 works by Picasso alongside 100 by more than 60 of his contemporaries. Curated by Ottinger, The Picasso Century sprawls across the ground floor at the NGV International in Melbourne as it examines the diverse influences, encounters and collaborative relationships that steered Picasso through many distinct artistic periods such as his Blue Period, Cubism and Surrealism and it draws lines between Picasso‚Äôs famous creations and the world around him. Somewhat ironically the exhibition, part of the NGV‚Äôs Melbourne Winter Masterpieces series, could be said to have had its genesis in Brisbane where NGV director Tony Ellwood served as director of QAGOMA ‚Äì he was the man who put the then brand-new Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) on the map. ‚ÄúI made an exhibition for Brisbane devoted to Surrealism with Tony,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when we began working together. Then he moved to Melbourne and said, ‚ÄòWe have to do something of the same period with the masterpieces from Paris.‚Äô We thought, ‚ÄòWhat shall we do?‚Äô Then we thought, ‚ÄòWe will do Picasso and the 20th century, let‚Äôs go.‚Äô‚Äù Ellwood was keen to get it done as soon as possible but Ottinger warned it would take a while. In fact it took a decade to secure the right works but it was worth the wait he says. ‚ÄúNow this is the occasion for anyone interested in 20th century art,‚Äù Ottinger insists. ‚ÄúYou come to this show and you will not only know Picasso, the genius, but you will see him in context and get a whole new idea of Picasso.‚Äù Ellwood says he wanted something special and was prepared to wait. ‚ÄúI did ask why I had to wait that long though,‚Äù he points out. ‚ÄúTo request key works was difficult. Didier said if we wait 10 years we will get everything we want. He has created a unique thesis for Melbourne and an exhibition that has never happened before.‚Äù Ellwood says with interstate travel back on the agenda he‚Äôs hoping people from Brisbane and elsewhere will make the trek to Melbourne for a bit of cultural tourism. With that in mind the gallery has partnered with Sofitel Melbourne on Collins which is part of a French hotel group located at what is, fortuitously, known as ‚Äúthe Paris end of Collins St‚Äù. Of course Picasso made his career in the French capital and Sofitel Melbourne on Collins has recently revamped rooms with French style in mind and incorporated French inspired photography in its new guest rooms. It has also created a Spanish themed lunch menu as a tribute to Picasso, available from July. The chef is working on the finer details of the Picasso Winter Lunch menu; each dish will have a link to Pablo Picasso and they‚Äôre working on the content that will be included on the printed menus. The NGV International meanwhile has refashioned its Garden restaurant as Bar Lourinha at NGV, featuring Matt McConnell and Jo Gamvros‚Äôs Iberian-Mediterranean food which complements the art. I came away from lunch there having eaten one of the great desserts of my life ‚Äì blood orange crema and burnt orange caramel. What has that got to do with art? Well it is the whole deal that Ellwood wants people to experience when they go to Melbourne for the exhibition, which includes a free NGV Kids exhibition titled Making Art: Imagine Everything is Real. The Picasso Century culminates, as usual, in a gorgeous gift shop. There are quite a few people walking around now with Picasso umbrellas. There will also be Friday night performances and other associated attractions. But, of course, the whole experience is centred on the exhibition itself with plenty of film footage and other added extras. It will take a few hours to do it justice and make sure you linger a while and watch the film about the making of Guernica, Picasso‚Äôs mural masterpiece against fascism. There is film footage of both world wars and the Spanish Civil War because Picasso‚Äôs career was punctuated by these earth-shattering events and they helped shape him and his art. His commitment to communism, which also made him a target for criticism, can be explained as a response to the rise of fascism in Europe. As for the work itself, you will stand in awe of some of these masterpieces including classics such as Weeping woman, painted in 1937, an iconic work that is actually owned by the NGV. The painting has a chequered history having once been stolen but later returned by a group calling itself the Australian Cultural Terrorists. The 1932 work Reclining woman (femme couchee) depicted Picasso‚Äôs romantic partner and muse from 1927 to about 1932, Marie-Therese Walter, and is one of the many depictions of the reclining female nude motif created by the artist during his lifetime. Another important woman in his life was photographer Dora Maar, who became his muse after they met in 1935, serving as the inspiration for many of his portraits including the 1938 Portrait of a woman (Portrait de femme) which is featured in the exhibition. The question of Picasso‚Äôs legacy in the 21st century is posed through the last work you will see before exiting to the gift shop (where you can purchase the 441-page book The Picasso Century), a 2009 video work entitled I see a woman crying (Weeping Woman), Tate Liverpool by Rineke Dijkstra. The work shows a group of schoolchildren who were asked to observe and describe Pablo Picasso‚Äôs (1881‚Äì1973) portrait Weeping woman 1937, in the Tate‚Äôs collection. (He did a few weeping women) A reproduction of Picasso‚Äôs painting hangs outside the frame of the camera for the children to look at but is never shown in the video. Dijkstra made the work during the exhibition The Fifth Floor: Ideas Taking Space at Tate Liverpool in 2008-9 and it‚Äôs a lovely, somewhat whimsical finale. ‚ñ† Melbourne Winter Masterpieces 2022: The Picasso Century at NGV International, St Kilda Rd, Melbourne until October 9, tickets $28/$30, children $10, ngv.vic.gov.auCREDIT: Story PHIL BROWNWord count: 1392Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The article highlights the estimated sale price of Picasso's ""Homme √° la Pipe"" at Sotheby's auction, which is expected to reach up to ¬£7.5 million. This significant increase in value suggests that Picasso's work is highly sought after and valuable, which can enhance his reputation as an artist. The article also mentions the upcoming auction, which could generate further interest and attention towards Picasso's work, further boosting his reputation.

Impact on Visibility: High

The article's focus on the estimated sale price of Picasso's artwork is likely to increase visibility among collectors, galleries, and the general public. The auction event itself is likely to generate significant attention and publicity, which can help increase visibility for Picasso's work. Additionally, the article mentions the recent surge in sales of Picasso's artwork, which suggests that there is renewed interest in his work, further increasing his visibility.

Impact on Market Confidence: Moderate

While the article does not explicitly mention market confidence in Picasso's work as a sound investment, it does suggest elements that could drive speculative buying. The mention of recent high sales and celebrity endorsements could potentially encourage investors to view Picasso's artwork as a valuable investment opportunity. However, the article does not provide enough information or context to significantly impact market confidence in a meaningful way.

(After it closes on May 15, the show travels to San Francisco's de Young Museum.) The revelation comes in a gallery with work Picasso did during World War II. Long gone is the joie de vivre of earlier decades -- the colorful paintings of sunlit beach scenes with frolicking bathers, and ever- available women. This is Picasso's bleakest period. His palette is restricted to browns, grays and blacks, pictorial space is sharply constricted, with figures and objects often literally boxed in, forms are painfully contorted, and themes of mortality preoccupy him, most powerfully in ""Death's Head"" (1943), a bronze sculpture of a pitted, scabrous skull. Then, out of the blue, comes a moment of wit and whimsy: ""Bull's Head"" (1942), a sculpture made from a bicycle saddle and handlebars. At once both childlike and highly sophisticated in its simplicity, it stands as an assertion of the transforming power of the human imagination at a time when human values were under siege. Consisting as it does of only two elements, ""Bull's Head"" is Picasso's sparest sculpture. And it is unique among his assemblages for its transparency. In most of them, the identity of the found objects, though not disguised, isn't emphasized. The toy car that forms the monkey's face in ""Baboon and Young"" (1951) is recognizable for what it is, yet at the same time is subsumed under the larger image of which it forms a part. In ""Bull's Head,"" by contrast, there is no attempt to play down the real-world identity of the constituent parts. Indeed, the sculpture's reductiveness and simplicity draw attention to them. Picasso's frank acknowledgment of these elements has prompted scholars to see affinities between this work and Marcel Duchamp's Readymades, where the Dada artist took commercially made, utilitarian objects and, with little or no modification, exhibited them under his name as works of art. The first of these, ""Bicycle Wheel"" (1913), can be seen in replica at the Museum of Modern Art. Yet there would seem to be more going on with ""Bull's Head"" than affinity. It is such an uncharacteristic work for Picasso that it is hard not to see it as, on some level, a direct response to Duchamp. What would make Picasso spare a thought for the clown prince of modern art at the very moment when there were far more important issues at stake, such as the fact that everything he held dear -- the values of Western civilization that formed the wellsprings of his art -- was going up in flames? Perhaps the fact that Duchamp himself represented a similarly sweeping threat. Readymades are antiart objects. Their purpose was nothing less than to overturn the entire tradition of artmaking as it had existed since ancient times, a tradition of which Picasso was both heir and beneficiary. If art was to be redefined as simply a question of shifting a pre-existing object from one context to another, then that meant an end to the idea of the art object as a product of the artist's hand, craft skill, culture, eye and imagination. Above all, that meant the end of the idea of the artist as shaman, a person able to transform and transfigure, who could conjure one thing, a work of art, out of another, its raw materials and constituent parts. Picasso, who worked at all hours, was single-minded in his pursuit of his art. Yet he also made it his business to stay abreast of what was going on around him. He was notorious for keeping tabs on other artists, dropping by their studios, visiting their exhibitions to check up on what they were doing -- all to ensure that his position as leader of the avant-garde remained unchallenged. In the same spirit, he would borrow and adapt their ideas and attempt to one-up them in other ways. He certainly knew about Duchamp, and indeed there had been an earlier point of contact between them. In the third volume of his biography of Picasso, John Richardson notes similarities between another Picasso sculpture, ""Head"" (1928), and Duchamp's ""Rotary Demisphere (Precision Optics)"" (1925), the two works having in common a circular form supported on tripod legs. In a 1912 collage, Picasso had pasted a portion of a newspaper headline that reads ""La Bataille S'est Engage"" (""the battle is joined""). And in ""Bull's Head"" the artist -- for whom so much of life was about gaining the upper hand, be it with his mistresses, portrait subjects or artists living and dead -- seems to be operating on the same principle. For he's taking on Duchamp on the Dadaist's own turf. Picasso's explicit acknowledgment of the saddle and handlebars makes ""Bull's Head"" a kind of Readymade-by-Picasso, a fact reinforced by the artist's description of the work's genesis: He ""often described how he had found the bicycle parts by chance and 'seen' them immediately as a bull's head, adding that, ideally, one day a cyclist would find his assemblage in a tip and 'see' it as a saddle and handlebars; in that way there would be a 'double metamorphosis,"" writes Elizabeth Cowling in ""Picasso: Sculptor/Painter."" Yet his purpose in annexing Duchamp's aesthetic of the Readymade is not to embrace it but to neutralize it and thus trump it. Duchamp's combinations are deliberately disjunctive. His bicycle wheel and stool are joined together precisely because they have nothing in common and, together, suggest nothing beyond themselves. Not so Picasso's. He goes all the way to the Duchampian brink, allowing the individual elements to stand for themselves to such a degree that he almost reaches the point at which illusion collapses, leaving us with just a bicycle saddle and some handlebars. But only almost, for despite that we are never in doubt that we are at all times looking at an image of a bull's head. Therein lies the bewitching power of ""Bull's Head,"" and Picasso's triumph. --- Mr. Gibson is the Journal's Leisure & Arts features editor.

That may be the wrong question to ask about the Spaniard who changed the course of 20th century art but in the age of cancel culture it‚Äôs a question that has been posed, appropriately or not. In the era of #MeToo his apparent chauvinism has been highlighted and even harped on by some. But, as they say in the movies, it‚Äôs complicated. Picasso, who died in 1973 aged 91, had many relationships, some of them torrid and troubled and he even admitted to one mistress that he found it hard to relate to women other than as ‚Äúgoddesses or doormats‚Äù. His personality, relationships and artistic legacy will be discussed in the public program that is part of National Gallery of Victoria‚Äôs landmark exhibition The Picasso Century at the NGV International until October 9. The man who created and curated the show, Didier Ottinger, deputy director of the Musee national d‚Äôart moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris, says the exhibition is, among other things, ‚Äúan answer to many of the criticisms now being addressed about Picasso‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are some very fierce feminists who have called him a misogynist and violent and so on,‚Äù Ottinger says during a whirlwind tour of the exhibition. ‚ÄúBut what you will discover in this show is that he was very sensitive, emotional and you just look at his work and you can see that. It‚Äôs not the work of an aggressive man. He is passionate, yes, and of course he was macho ‚Ä¶ he was from the south of Spain. If you really want to understand his feelings just listen to flamenco music. ‚ÄúI hope this exhibition will show who Picasso really was and that might calm things down a bit.‚Äù It will also excite people too because it is an extraordinary cavalcade of 20th century art charting the amazing career of Picasso in dialogue with many artists, poets and intellectuals with whom he interacted in his adopted city of Paris including Guillaume Apollinaire, Georges Braque, Salvador Dali and Gertrude Stein. Developed exclusively for the NGV by the Centre Pompidou and the Musee national Picasso-Paris, the exhibition features 80 works by Picasso alongside 100 by more than 60 of his contemporaries. Curated by Ottinger, The Picasso Century sprawls across the ground floor at the NGV International in Melbourne as it examines the diverse influences, encounters and collaborative relationships that steered Picasso through many distinct artistic periods such as his Blue Period, Cubism and Surrealism and it draws lines between Picasso‚Äôs famous creations and the world around him. Somewhat ironically the exhibition, part of the NGV‚Äôs Melbourne Winter Masterpieces series, could be said to have had its genesis in Brisbane where NGV director Tony Ellwood served as director of QAGOMA ‚Äì he was the man who put the then brand-new Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) on the map. ‚ÄúI made an exhibition for Brisbane devoted to Surrealism with Tony,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when we began working together. Then he moved to Melbourne and said, ‚ÄòWe have to do something of the same period with the masterpieces from Paris.‚Äô We thought, ‚ÄòWhat shall we do?‚Äô Then we thought, ‚ÄòWe will do Picasso and the 20th century, let‚Äôs go.‚Äô‚Äù Ellwood was keen to get it done as soon as possible but Ottinger warned it would take a while. In fact it took a decade to secure the right works but it was worth the wait he says. ‚ÄúNow this is the occasion for anyone interested in 20th century art,‚Äù Ottinger insists. ‚ÄúYou come to this show and you will not only know Picasso, the genius, but you will see him in context and get a whole new idea of Picasso.‚Äù Ellwood says he wanted something special and was prepared to wait. ‚ÄúI did ask why I had to wait that long though,‚Äù he points out. ‚ÄúTo request key works was difficult. Didier said if we wait 10 years we will get everything we want. He has created a unique thesis for Melbourne and an exhibition that has never happened before.‚Äù Ellwood says with interstate travel back on the agenda he‚Äôs hoping people from around the country will make the trek to Melbourne for a bit of cultural tourism. With that in mind the gallery has partnered with Sofitel Melbourne on Collins which is part of a French hotel group located at what is, fortuitously, known as ‚Äúthe Paris end of Collins St‚Äù. Of course Picasso made his career in the French capital and Sofitel Melbourne on Collins has recently revamped rooms with French style in mind and incorporated French inspired photography in its new guest rooms. It has also created a Spanish themed lunch menu as a tribute to Picasso, available from July. The chef is working on the finer details of the Picasso Winter Lunch menu; each dish will have a link to Pablo Picasso and they‚Äôre working on the content that will be included on the printed menus. The NGV International meanwhile has refashioned its Garden restaurant as Bar Lourinha at NGV, featuring Matt McConnell and Jo Gamvros‚Äôs Iberian-Mediterranean food which complements the art. I came away from lunch there having eaten one of the great desserts of my life ‚Äì blood orange crema and burnt orange caramel. What has that got to do with art? Well it is the whole deal that Ellwood wants people to experience when they go to Melbourne for the exhibition, which includes a free NGV Kids exhibition titled Making Art: Imagine Everything is Real. The Picasso Century culminates, as usual, in a gorgeous gift shop. There are quite a few people walking around now with Picasso umbrellas. There will also be Friday night performances and other associated attractions. But, of course, the whole experience is centred on the exhibition itself with plenty of film footage and other added extras. It will take a few hours to do it justice and make sure you linger a while and watch the film about the making of Guernica, Picasso‚Äôs mural masterpiece against fascism. There is film footage of both world wars and the Spanish Civil War because Picasso‚Äôs career was punctuated by these earth-shattering events and they helped shape him and his art. His commitment to communism, which also made him a target for criticism, can be explained as a response to the rise of fascism in Europe. As for the work itself, you will stand in awe of some of these masterpieces including classics such as Weeping woman, painted in 1937, an iconic work that is actually owned by the NGV. The painting has a chequered history having once been stolen but later returned by a group calling itself the Australian Cultural Terrorists. The 1932 work Reclining woman (femme couchee) depicted Picasso‚Äôs romantic partner and muse from 1927 to about 1932, Marie-Therese Walter, and is one of the many depictions of the reclining female nude motif created by the artist during his lifetime. Another important woman in his life was photographer Dora Maar, who became his muse after they met in 1935, serving as the inspiration for many of his portraits including the 1938 Portrait of a woman (Portrait de femme) which is featured in the exhibition. The question of Picasso‚Äôs legacy in the 21st century is posed through the last work you will see before exiting to the gift shop (where you can purchase the 441-page book The Picasso Century), a 2009 video work entitled I see a woman crying (Weeping Woman), Tate Liverpool by Rineke Dijkstra. The work shows a group of schoolchildren who were asked to observe and describe Pablo Picasso‚Äôs (1881‚Äì1973) portrait Weeping woman 1937, in the Tate‚Äôs collection. (He did a few weeping women) A reproduction of Picasso‚Äôs painting hangs outside the frame of the camera for the children to look at but is never shown in the video. Dijkstra made the work during the exhibition The Fifth Floor: Ideas Taking Space at Tate Liverpool in 2008-9 and it‚Äôs a lovely, somewhat whimsical finale.

The impressively dramatic changes which came over his political life and married life are numerous and he was the subject of favourable appraisal and hostile criticism levelled from the modern world of art. In personal life he was married to a lady around forty years younger and was an ardent communist in 1944. Most critics of his paintings rate him the superlative painter in the modern world of art and perhaps in the history of art. On the other hand, some critics charge him with the crime of mishandling and misdirecting the field of art by creating nonsense paintings.Whatever is said of him, Picasso provides a perfect example for promoting the art of painting. That is to say, an artist permanently damages the quality of art if he keeps strictly to the conventional ways and tradition. Picasso himself registered his protests against the non progressive trends for and adorations of traditions.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at htsyndication@hindustantimes.comWord count: 208Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But the reason he gave for disliking the painting was not one you might expect to hear from an 88-year-old former real estate broker. ''It's like he's trying to tell a story using words that don't exist,'' Mr. Rosen said finally of Picasso, fixing the painter's work with a critic's stare. ''He knows what he means, but we don't.'' This chasm of understanding is one that Mr. Rosen himself stares into every day. He has midstage Alzheimer's disease, as did the rest of the men and women who were sitting alongside him in a small semicircle at the museum, all of them staring up at the Picasso. It was a Tuesday, and the museum was closed, but if it had been open other visitors could have easily mistaken the group for any guided tour. Mr. Rosen and his friends did not wear the anxious, confused looks they had worn when they first arrived at the museum. They did not quarrel in the way that those suffering from Alzheimer's sometimes do. And when they talked about the paintings, they did not repeat themselves or lose the thread of the discussion, as they often do at the long-term care home where most of them live in Palisades, N.Y. At one point, a member of the tour, Sheila Barnes, 82, a quick-witted former newspaper editor who suffers from acute short-term memory loss, was even uncharacteristically aware of the limitations of her memory. ''If I've told this story before, then somebody just say, 'Cool it, Sheila,''' she announced, laughing. She was a test subject, in a sense, in a growing effort to use art as a therapeutic tool for those in the grip of Alzheimer's. Art therapy, both appreciating art and making it, has been used for decades as a nonmedical way to help a wide variety of people -- abused children, prisoners and cancer and Alzheimer's patients. But much of this work has taken place in nursing homes and hospitals. Now museums like the Modern and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are trying to bring it into their galleries, using their collections as powerful ways to engage minds damaged by dementia. It seems to be working, though no one knows exactly how. While extensive research has been conducted on the effects of music and performing arts on brain function -- the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function in the Bronx has been studying the phenomenon for a decade now -- there has been comparatively little work done in the visual arts. What exists mostly is a stockpile of anecdotal evidence, encouraging but murky. Why did Willem de Kooning become more productive, almost maniacally so, as he descended into Alzheimer's? Why does frontotemporal dementia, a relatively rare form of non-Alzheimer's brain disease, cause some people who had no previous interest or aptitude for art to develop remarkable artistic talent and drive? ''Certainly it's not just a visual experience -- it's an emotional one,'' said Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and writer. ''In an informal way I have often seen quite demented patients recognize and respond vividly to paintings and delight in painting at a time when they are scarcely responsive to words and disoriented and out of it. I think that recognition of visual art can be very deep.'' The Museum of Modern Art began to experiment with short, focused tours a year ago, working with an Alzheimer's care company called Hearthstone, based in Lexington, Mass. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, began to reach out to Alzheimer's patients more than five years ago, offering tours alongside those for other disabled groups. And the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn., also offers tours, in addition to conducting a program in which it sends educators to Alzheimer's care facilities to help with art therapy. At the Modern, which plans to expand the Alzheimer's program next year to families and other care providers, the effects of the tours are often striking and seem to speak -- in a world of reproduction -- to the power of the original. (For now, the tours focus on representational art, on the theory that it's an easier touchstone for narratives and memories. There are no Pollocks, for example.) Besides improving patients' moods for hours and even days, the tours seem to demonstrate that the disease, while diminishing sufferers' abilities in so many ways, can also sometimes spark interpretive and expressive powers that had previously lay hidden. Mr. Rosen, for instance, who had little interest in art when he was younger, talked with ease and inventiveness about the composition of Rousseau's ''Sleeping Gypsy.''''If you met these people back where they lived on an ordinary day, you simply would not see them being this articulate and this assured,'' said John Zeisel, the president of Hearthstone, who conceived the program with Francesca Rosenberg, the Modern's director of community and access programs. On that Tuesday, as the group of two men and three women and a volunteer museum educator wound their way slowly through the empty galleries, Kerry Mills, who runs the residence in Palisades, pointed out one elderly man in particular, Frank Ertola, a former New York City police detective who was making his third visit to the museum. Mr. Ertola, 86, burly with a thick sweep of white hair, had been living in the residence for almost three years and had recently begun to struggle with his emotions. ''The smallest things in the world irritate him, and it's become very hard to get him engaged,'' Ms. Mills said. But as he sat on a folding stool in front of Andrew Wyeth's ''Christina's World,'' he smiled, listened and at one point -- after abandoning a wheelchair he had requested when he arrived -- stood and speculated on why there was an ellipse of mown grass surrounding the haunting farmhouse in the painting's upper right corner. ''It's to let you know that someone lives there,'' he said. Later, in front of Matisse's ''Dance,'' he was asked to provide a title for the painting, and on a notecard wrote ''Dance of the Beauties.'' He smiled rakishly when asked to explain. ''I see a naked woman?'' he said, shrugging. ''I think it's beautiful.'' Ms. Mills was surprised to see him so talkative. ''He was like he was last year,'' she said later. ''He's such a fun person and such a gentleman, and all those things come out when he's at the museum.'' More than four million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and the number is expected to rise as the nation's overall population ages. With no cure on the horizon, caregivers are increasingly exploring art as a way to help manage the disease, and they take encouragement from the results with music. Dr. Sacks noted that exposure to music can even result in lowered dosages for patients being medicated for cognitive and emotional disorders. One avenue of thinking about both music and art, he said, is that it engages parts of the brain that remain intact long after the onset of dementia and that have to do with procedural memory -- the kind that governs routine activities like walking, eating, shaving. One musician whom Dr. Sacks has observed has almost entirely lost his memory, but his musical memory is intact. ''Nietzsche used to say that we listened to music with our muscles,'' he said. The question is whether a similar mechanism is at work in making and looking at art. The National Institute on Aging held a conference in Alexandria, Va., last year to allow researchers to compare notes on Alzheimer's and artistic activity. One speaker, Bruce L. Miller, clinical director of the Memory and Aging Center at the University of California, San Francisco, said he believed that even sitting and looking at art is much more active than most people assume, and such activity could have positive effects on damaged brains. ''There's a lot of general excitement in this area, but not much known about it,'' he said later in an interview. ''I think there is, tucked in there, a research question that really hasn't been answered yet, which is: by looking at or making art, is there a way to improve the brains of those with Alzheimer's?'' Museum and Alzheimer's care officials say that at the very least, they see temporary but palpable, and moving, improvement in the small group of people who have participated in the tours. Hannah Goodwin, the manager of accessibility at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, recounted watching an elderly man react to a Stuart Davis painting. ''Very spontaneously, he just starting talking about the painting and about the time period in New York,'' she said. ''He was talking about jazz and improvisation and everything. It was very beautiful and unexpected. There was this absolute clarity and connection that I think was really sparked by the painting.'' Irene Copeland Brenton, 73, one of the visitors to the Modern on that Tuesday, suffers from a kind of Alzheimer's that has made it very difficult for her to read and to find the right words to say. But in front of the Wyeth and later the Rousseau, she was almost loquacious. Her husband, Myron, said that while specific memories of the museum might evaporate, she seemed to retain a kind of emotional memory long after the visit ended. When he reminded her that she had visited the museum and that Ms. Mills had written an account of it, he said, ''her face lit up.'' ''She really wanted to hear about the whole thing,'' he said. ''It seemed the experience relived itself when I prompted her.'' That day at the museum, looking longingly at the figure lying in a field at the bottom of the Wyeth painting, she seemed to identify deeply with the thin young woman in the dress, her left hand reaching out toward the farmhouse. ''You can't see her face,'' Ms. Brenton said, ''but looking at her you get the feeling she's happy.'' She was asked why. ''Because you know she's going to get to the house,'' she said, adding: ''I'd like to go into that house, too.''

It has always fascinated me,"" he said.The movie will also examine the relationship between the artist and his French lover Dora Marr, who was with him at the time he made 'Guernica'.It will also show his reaction to the destruction of the town that gave the artwork its name during the Spanish Civil War.Picasso, who died in 1973 at the age of 91, has long been of interest to art lover Banderas, as they come from the same city on Spain's southern coast.The movie is slated to have a budget of 7.9 million dollars, and will be directed by Carlos Saura.It means a big pay cut for the actor, who usually commands multi-million dollar fees.The film is slated to be shot in Paris and Guernica next summer.

And how can you not love a car named after the man who once said: ""There are only two types of women: goddesses and doormats""? He should have known. Pablo Picasso was a noted philanderer, and loved women all his life.The Citroen C3 Picasso is actually one of the most fun cars I've seen in ages. And, oh boy, does it make people smile! It turns heads wherever you go, and it was with real reluctance that I handed back the keys to the vehicle.It's more than just a cube on wheels, or a ""spacebox"", as Citroen calls it: the remarkably cleverly designed car oozes ingenuity, and innovation. Flexibility, versatility and thoughtfulness were obviously key in the designers' minds when they sat down with their first drawing boards. The result is a funky little multi-purpose car that delivers driving pleasure and great aesthetics.Picasso once remarked that ""art is the elimination of the unnecessary"", and Citroen has taken this to heart with the car. There's no fussiness here, no wasted space. There's stowage for Africa - or France! - with drawers under the front seats, two boxes at the feet of the rear passengers, and even the boot floor can be positioned at two levels so you get a beautifully flat and useful surface when the rear seat is folded down.Loved the leather steering wheel with its chrome inserts, but the sunroof, with its double blind opening system, could possibly be improved upon. A male colleague, a surfer with meaty biceps, was in the front passenger seat and decided to open the blinds: he nearly expired of heart failure, as did I, when they shot apart and almost ripped themselves off the roof. Only later, when reading the instructions, did I see that you're supposed to ""Guide the shutters completely open. Do NOT let them go when opening as this can cause damage"". Point noted, Citroen!However, the rest of the car got the thumbs up all round. The 1 600 is super quiet on the road, has a more than satisfactory five-speed manual gearbox, and goes like the clappers when you want it to. An unusual feature is the scented air freshener, operable via a control knob - which took me ages to find. I liked the auto headlight and rain-sensor windscreen wipers, and the fact that it has six airbags, ABS, EDB etc. Loved the choice of colours, too.With its brilliant styling, its overall appeal and performance - and did I mention the humungous amount of boot space? - the price tag of R206 400 isn't over the top.

Pablo Picasso's non-Cubist hits,Toronto Star,17 July 2010,"Abstract [Pablo Picasso] - at least the artist's ever-evolving reputation - has morphed into the equivalent of the Steven Spielberg of the museum circuit, capable of providing a major blockbuster about every two years. The Met's show - with 300 pieces totalling most of the museum's Picasso holdings, including its 200 prints - is matched in downtown Manhattan by ""Picasso: Themes and Variations"" at the Museum of Modern Art, with 100 of the artist's prints. The rivalry has not gone unnoticed. This doesn't make the Met's ""Picasso"" a good show. It's far too ersatz for that. It does make it a surprisingly involving exhibition, something that cannot be said about a number of other recent Picasso shows. MoMA's ""http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/966Themes and VariationsEND,"" while more consistent than the Met exhibition, feels like a textbook placed on its walls. Sexy it's not.

Erotic Scene shows a young man with a look on his face of quiet self-satisfaction as he lazes on a couch in the manner of Francisco Goya's The Nude Maja enjoying the oral ministrations of a naked young woman who appears to be turning a bluish purple in the process. La Douleur - as the painting has come to be known - indicates nothing more graphic than Internet browsers have already come across in the way of erotica. Yet because the 1902 (or 1903) painting is by Pablo Picasso, La Douleur has taken on many new layers of meaning and brought a lot of new attention to the rest of the exhibition around it, ""Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art."" The undisguised actuality of the scene gives gallery-goers and critics alike a jolt of recognition - something akin to finding a bit of truth in a TV sitcom - when something from real life finds its way through the made-up world around it. Picasso - at least the artist's ever-evolving reputation - has morphed into the equivalent of the Steven Spielberg of the museum circuit, capable of providing a major blockbuster about every two years. The Met's show - with 300 pieces totalling most of the museum's Picasso holdings, including its 200 prints - is matched in downtown Manhattan by ""Picasso: Themes and Variations"" at the Museum of Modern Art, with 100 of the artist's prints. The rivalry has not gone unnoticed. The Met came late and reluctantly to Picasso, mostly because of Gertrude Stein's decision in 1946 to give it her famous portrait by Picasso, where she looks as if her angular face were chipped out of Paul Cezanne's chiselled Mont Sainte-Victoire. The work, Gertrude Stein (1905-06) - the best-known piece in the Met show - ""is the only reproduction of me which is always I, for me,"" the expatriate American writer insisted. Met co-curator Gary Tinterow helps explain the Picasso gap between the two museums with the admission in his show's catalogue that, ""unlike the much larger and well-balanced"" MoMA collection, the Met's Picasso collection ""developed by happenstance rather than by design."" (The Met's Susan Alyson Stein is the other curator.) Happenstance has its rewards, though. For one thing, it brought to the Met a wealth of Picasso's early work, particularly his moody Blue period work where his socialist sympathies saturate the remarkable The Blind Man's Meal (1903). Happenstance also can allow a lot more speculative latitude. In exhibiting lesser pieces - La Douleur is a primo example - the Met offers work that would never have made it into a show filled only with Picasso's Greatest Cubist Hits. With ""http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId={cd70b3f0-d1b8-4501-9b63-085d213e0e9b}Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of ArtEND"" - savaged in a New Yorker blurb as akin to ""the second hour of a yard sale"" - the Met sees its Picasso holdings from the inside out, mostly in terms of the many donations made to the collection. The catalogue includes a number of photos showing well-heeled collectors inside of their homes. But for the rest of the world, the Met show could as easily be called ""Picasso for the Viagra Generation."" Most Cubist-period Picasso shows suggest the artist wasn't up to much before 1910 - the Cubist sweet spot when Picasso had gone totally geometric alongside Georges Braque - and that he never did much of anything after to match that fabulous period in his life. The Met's ""Picasso"" pushes for something quite the opposite. It emphasizes - perhaps unintentionally - sexuality as the other driving force in the artist's life, not only when he was a young stud, new to Paris, but well into his 90s. (Born in 1881, he died in 1973.) This doesn't make the Met's ""Picasso"" a good show. It's far too ersatz for that. It does make it a surprisingly involving exhibition, something that cannot be said about a number of other recent Picasso shows. MoMA's ""http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/966Themes and VariationsEND,"" while more consistent than the Met exhibition, feels like a textbook placed on its walls. Sexy it's not. Picasso's sexuality would hardly seem to be new news when stories of his rough effect on women - Marie-Therese Walter, his zaftig early mistress, shot herself after his death, as did his second wife, Jacqueline Roque - have led him in recent years to be described in almost monstrously deviant terms. Picasso-as-Scary Monster theory is the basis of Arianna Huffington's Picasso: Creator and Destroyer. Francoise Gilot in particular led the way in encouraging this ominous Portrait of the Artist as a Sexy Beast after Picasso denied their two children, Claude and Paloma, the right to use the Picasso name. Gilot, as far as I remember, is the only one of the artist's lovers to not be exhibited in the Met show. Two lovers who did make the cut - first wife Olga Khokhlova and the photographer Dora Maar - appear as exploding shapes. Ignoring a suggestion of anti-Picasso sexist rhetoric, the Met's ""Picasso"" suggests the artist's instinct for the erotic wasn't something channelled only by anger but was rarely far from everything he produced, from the beginning to the very end of his life. Early on, that meant hurried painting of soft porn such as La Douleur for someone else's consumption as a way to make some quick cash. Mid-career works reveal the assured sensuality of Man with a Lollipop (Aug. 20, 1938) - a far more erotically ramped-up figure than any of Picasso's Satyrs - where the artist has seemingly given himself both male and female genitalia. ""We don't do it anymore, but the desire for it is still with us,"" Picasso once said about sex. Evidence of the artist's undiminished erotic imagination is found everywhere in the last gallery in the Met show, showing his 347 Suite of etchings printed by the Crommelynck brothers, Aldo and Piero, who'd set up their shop near the artist's studio in Mougins near Cannes. (If any aspect of Picasso's genius can be said to be ""hidden,"" it's his staggering virtuosity as a printmaker equally at home with dry point and aquatint. He made around 2,400 prints over the years.) Picasso's boisterous old musketeers looking for love in all the right places, the chubby hookers willing to give it to them and The Fat Courtesan Greeted by Three Gentlemen are together far more suggestive of the funhouse than the whorehouse. Close to death, Picasso's imagination was still up for a tumble. ""Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art"" continues to Aug. 1 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

But, to be considered as significant in the world of art: That is a big deal! An artist‚Äôs contribution can only be assessed, and fully realized in retrospect. Once an artist is given credit for having changed the world in some way, then they are considered as significant. That distinction may be given as a result of insight, talent, timing, or affiliation.Every once in a while a visionary will come along who is recognized to be a significant artist during their own lifetime. This was certainly the case with Spanish-born Pablo Ruiz Picasso (1881-1973). Credited as being the most important artist of the twentieth century, this individual was so prolific, (50,000 plus artworks), and ever changing, that his work is divided into segments. These eight distinct periods (which correspond with events in his life), include: All work done before 1901, the Blue period, the Rose period, the Cubism period, the African period, the Surrealist period, and then, all of the Later Works.Picasso demonstrated an amazing artistic talent in his early years. The thing that most people do not realize is that he painted in a realistic manner throughout his childhood and adolescence. He received formal training in traditional art at a very young age by his father who was an art professor. He was then admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in Barcelona, Spain at age 13. To see some of his earlier works gives prospective to how good Picasso was as a realist. It was after 1901 that his style changed as he began to rebel by experimenting with different theories, techniques, and ideas. Always seeming to be one step ahead of what would be the next important thing in art, his work was in constant flux. I would like to point out just a couple of Picasso‚Äôs many contributions:Analytical Cubism, (1907-1911) is a style which was developed by Picasso, and employed the use of monochrome neutral colors. His theory, (at the time), was that objects could be taken apart visually, and then analyzed in terms of their shapes and sizes. In doing this, everything could then be converted into a triangle, rectangle, or circle. Love it, or hate it, this thinking revolutionized European, and then American painting and sculpture. It also helped to inspire related movements in music and literature. After that movement took hold, Picasso was joined by many other artists as the style evolved into what was called Synthetic Cubism, (1912-1919). This new movement took his concept one step further by introducing different textures and surfaces into the work. This was the beginning of collage materials becoming ingredients of fine art work.Picasso devoted all of his energy to his work, and seemed to become more daring as time went on. His art also became more colorful, and expressive along the way. As late as the 1960s until his death at age 91, (while in his 80s), he was still producing an incredible amount of artwork. These final works were a mixture of many different styles. Toward the end of his life he was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúMy childhood was spent learning to paint like an adult, and then the rest of my life was spent learning to paint like a child.‚Äù*Sal Maccarone is an American author, designer, furniture maker and sculptor.

They were holding their own until that point and Leeds boss Bielsa admitted it was a major flashpoint in the contest.The Argentine said: ""The fact we played with one more player made it easy for us. It's difficult to think that we deserved to lose the game. We dominated for long parts.""I could see that we virtually didn't concede any chances to the opposition.""Bielsa had special praise for game-changer Hernandez. ""Pablo is always a player with a lot of influence,"" he said. ""He always improves the style of our team and when he scores goals he's even more important.""His opposite number, Lee Johnson, left Yorkshire cursing his side's bad luck in having Brownhill dismissed.But he believed his Bristol City players could journey back to the West Country with their heads held high despite sinking to a fourth straight defeat.Johnson said: ""We were looking like a side which was going to win the game. I was very pleased with the performance.""Our shape was good. We hustled. We harried. And it was important we got our identity back.""The back four worked extremely hard. The individuals will go away knowing that they will have got their game back.""Leeds are a good side but we nullified them for long periods."" It was obvious from the first few minutes that Leeds were up for this one after the horror of The Hawthorns HE'S ¬¶which still haunts Bielsa, who took full responsibility for the 4-1 loss.Marcelo thrilled Now, here was the chance to change his tactics - and his gameplan worked in his favour.There was no faulting Leeds' purpose and passion in a rousing opening 45 minutes when the deadlock should have been shattered.Leeds threw everything at Bristol City, spurred on by a restless full house who were in the mood to cheer goals. But none came despite an abundance of half-chances with both sides lacking a true killer instinct. Ezgjan Alioski thought he had struck gold in the 18th minute with a blockbuster which was brilliantly saved by Bristol City keeper Niki Maenpaa.And Roofe was totally frustrated when his effort was blocked instead of sending the back of the net bulging.The visitors threatened in periods with quick-silver build ups of play and pops at debut keeper Will Huffer.But there was no end result - much to Leeds' relief.The hosts were given a huge helping hand when Brownhill was sent off 10 minutes after the break when he fouled Roofe for his second bookable offence.And the Leeds striker showed no side effects when he found himself clear, only to pull his shot wide of the target. Barry Douglas thought he had done the business in the 67th minute when his curled shot was tipped away by Maenpaa to produce even more sighs.But spirits were lifted two minutes later when Roofe fired Leeds ahead.Hernandez did well to carve out the opportunity, swivelling to shoot for goal - and Roofe made no mistake to send Elland Road into a frenzy.And then with three minutes left, Hernandez got on to the end of a cross from substitute Samuel Saiz to clinically head home.There was a collective sharp intake of breath all around the famous old stadium as Leeds United took another huge step back to the big stage which they last starred on in 2004. They host lowly Reading on Tuesday night.STAT ATTACK LEEDS UNITED have lost just two of their 24 league games against Bristol City in the second tier - and those two defeats were separated by more than 90 years (0-1 in both 1921 and 2016).CREDIT: By Steve Millar At Elland RoadCAPTION: ¬¶ HE'S SITTING COMFORTABLY: Marcelo Bielsa was thrilled with the winWord count: 764Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

As proof, Parisians have been lining up hour after hour for a show called ""Picasso and the Masters.""It sets the modern master high up on a pedestal, alongside established geniuses such as El Greco, Velazquez, Poussin, Rembrandt, Delacroix, Manet and Renoir. And it allows him to colonize three of the city's most famous venues This Picasso project stretches from the Louvre to the Musee d'Orsay to the Grand Palais.But here's the truly peculiar thing about Picasso Those of us most smitten with him don't necessarily admire all of his individual pictures. What we love is how, across a seven-decade career filled with works that can be ugly or dumb or debauched, he constantly tests how pictures work and what they mean.""Picasso and the Masters"" turns out to be not so much about Picasso the artist as Picasso the art historian. It shows that Picasso the great painter could never have existed without his scholarly self.His most intense confrontation with the past is on view at the Musee d'Orsay. There, a small suite of galleries has been devoted to Manet's great Dejeuner sur l'herbe and to 41 of Picasso's variations on it done in the early 1960s.At the Louvre, one side of its great Salon Denon has been cleared for Delacroix's famous harem scene from 1834, the Femmes d'Alger and for Picasso's two dozen versions of it, done in 1954 and '55.And in the Grand Palais display - with 210 pictures, it's the main ring in this Picasso circus - we catch up with the artist two years further on, digging deeper into Velazquez's Las Meninas. The show hammers home a point that could be made about almost any major artist Picasso's innovations depended on a thorough knowledge of earlier art.

The works, which make up the most significant exhibition of Picasso's art held in Australia, range from pieces done by the artist as a teenager to ones he created just months before his death. Mr Capon said the arrival of the works, which will go on public display at the gallery from today, was a great moment for the gallery. ""It's fun unpacking a box and finding a Picasso inside because it doesn't often happen,"" Mr Capon said at a preview of the works yesterday. ""It was a very nice Christmas present."" Mr Capon said it was impossible to put a dollar value on the works and the gallery had ""more (security) than we have ever had before"". The exhibition, which is usually housed in the Musee National Picasso in Paris, is expected to draw a ""huge and appreciative"" audience.

""You have to think when I was going to school, when I was a little kid [holding] the hand of my mother, we always cross in front of Picasso's house where he was born.""[It was] a time in Spain in which we didn't have too many international heroes, so Picasso trespassed that barrier at a time in which we were pretty much isolated by the dictatorship with [General] Francisco Franco in power,"" Banderas says.""So I grew up with the projection of this huge artist who was capable of actually making the people all around the world fall in love with his art, and he was [from] my home town, and I was able to just see the house where he was born. That was very important for me.""Banderas is playing the legend in Genius: Picasso, the second season of National Geographic's Genius series; the first, which explored the life of Albert Einstein, was the most watched series launch in the history of the channel and drew 10 nominations for Emmy awards.The opportunity to play Picasso has been offered to Banderas several times during his career, but he had previously declined. ""I said no before because it was a big sense of responsibility ... that, for whatever reason, I didn't want to accept in other times of my life,"" he says. ""This time I felt it was the right time.""This project, Banderas says, ""came with great scripts, with seriousness, with [the brand of] National Geographic, which was giving the entire project all the facts that we needed to create the complexity of a character like this.""In playing him, Banderas says he has discovered that Picasso the man and Picasso the artist were inextricably connected. ""His artistic dimension was total linked to his personality, to his personal dimension,"" Banderas says. ""There was no separation between the artist and the person.""He was not only a man who was very capable painting, drawing the reality, but he put that at the service of the political and social context of his time, a guy who was a visionary and had a long sight for the future and, also, an introspection of himself, a reflection about life itself,"" Banderas says. ""That was very important.""While the producers are adamant the series is not a hagiography, it does seem to sidestep the complex question of the darker side of Picasso's relationships with women, in particular the claims he was an abusive misogynist.Banderas claims not to have come across that side of Picasso in his research for the role, but says there was a deeply damaging side to the artist: ""There were no masks with Picasso; Picasso stopped loving somebody, he says it,"" Banderas says. ""We have to find a balance to explain all of those stories that happen with [the] women, because they are complicated, they are not simple.""To prepare for the role, Banderas says he did as much research as he could. ""It's been interesting because Picasso, everybody wants to own Picasso or a little bit of Picasso,"" he says. ""In Barcelona, the people think Picasso is from Barcelona. In Paris they say, no, Picasso is French and in Malaga, we still say, no, Picasso was born here.""At the same time, when you find many people wrote about him, you may be analysing an event that is factual [but] many people talk about the same event in different ways,"" Banderas says.""So you have to be very careful, and you have to read continuously in between lines to actually make a composition of what was the reality of what happened to him, the way that he thought, why he made very specific choices,"" he says.And on top of that, Banderas says, he gave himself permission to be ""a little bit creative"".""I think my directors and my producers are doing the same thing for the same reason that Picasso one day took a Velazquez painting, like Las Meninas, a very famous figurative painting, and did his own take on it,"" Banderas says.""So we, with all the data and all the information that we have, we have to have a certain margin to give our interpretation of what we believe Picasso was,"" he says. ""That's how I am attacking the character.""And, he adds with a wry grin, there is a lot riding on it.

The joy and challenge of playing Pablo Picasso,The Canberra Times,23 Apr 2018,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitAntonio Banderas had been offered the role before. This time he couldn't say no, writes Michael Idato.Taking on the role of one of the 20th century's most influential and celebrated artists, Spanish-born Pablo Picasso, had particular significance for actor Antonio Banderas.Like Picasso, the 57-year-old star of Evita and Philadelphia was born in the port city of Malaga, on Spain's Costa del Sol.""Picasso has been a very important figure in my life,"" Banderas says. ""You have to think when I was going to school, when I was a little kid [holding] the hand of my mother, we always cross in front of Picasso's house where he was born.""[It was] a time in Spain in which we didn't have too many international heroes, so Picasso trespassed that barrier at a time in which we were pretty much isolated by the dictatorship with [General] Francisco Franco in power,"" Banderas says.""So I grew up with the projection of this huge artist who was capable of actually making the people all around the world fall in love with his art, and he was [from] my home town, and I was able to just see the house where he was born. That was very important for me.""Banderas is playing the legend in Genius: Picasso, the second season of National Geographic's Genius series; the first, which explored the life of Albert Einstein, was the most watched series launch in the history of the channel and drew 10 nominations for Emmy awards.The opportunity to play Picasso has been offered to Banderas several times during his career, but he had previously declined. ""I said no before because it was a big sense of responsibility ... that, for whatever reason, I didn't want to accept in other times of my life,"" he says. ""This time I felt it was the right time.""This project, Banderas says, ""came with great scripts, with seriousness, with [the brand of] National Geographic, which was giving the entire project all the facts that we needed to create the complexity of a character like this.""In playing him, Banderas says he has discovered that Picasso the man and Picasso the artist were inextricably connected. ""His artistic dimension was total linked to his personality, to his personal dimension,"" Banderas says. ""There was no separation between the artist and the person.""He was not only a man who was very capable painting, drawing the reality, but he put that at the service of the political and social context of his time, a guy who was a visionary and had a long sight for the future and, also, an introspection of himself, a reflection about life itself,"" Banderas says. ""That was very important.""While the producers are adamant the series is not a hagiography, it does seem to sidestep the complex question of the darker side of Picasso's relationships with women, in particular the claims he was an abusive misogynist.Banderas claims not to have come across that side of Picasso in his research for the role, but says there was a deeply damaging side to the artist: ""There were no masks with Picasso; Picasso stopped loving somebody, he says it,"" Banderas says. ""We have to find a balance to explain all of those stories that happen with [the] women, because they are complicated, they are not simple.""To prepare for the role, Banderas says he did as much research as he could. ""It's been interesting because Picasso, everybody wants to own Picasso or a little bit of Picasso,"" he says. ""In Barcelona, the people think Picasso is from Barcelona. In Paris they say, no, Picasso is French and in Malaga, we still say, no, Picasso was born here.""At the same time, when you find many people wrote about him, you may be analysing an event that is factual [but] many people talk about the same event in different ways,"" Banderas says.""So you have to be very careful, and you have to read continuously in between lines to actually make a composition of what was the reality of what happened to him, the way that he thought, why he made very specific choices,"" he says.And on top of that, Banderas says, he gave himself permission to be ""a little bit creative"".""I think my directors and my producers are doing the same thing for the same reason that Picasso one day took a Velazquez painting, like Las Meninas, a very famous figurative painting, and did his own take on it,"" Banderas says.""So we, with all the data and all the information that we have, we have to have a certain margin to give our interpretation of what we believe Picasso was,"" he says. ""That's how I am attacking the character.""And, he adds with a wry grin, there is a lot riding on it. ""It is a lot of responsibility ... when you play a character that already existed, it happened to me a couple times in my life before,"" he says. ""But in this particular case, I have to be very careful for the reason that if I don't portray him properly I may not be able to go back to my home town.""‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óèWHATGenius: PicassoWHENTuesday, National Geographic, 7.30pmCREDIT: Michael IdatoWord count: 878Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Pablo Picasso who was one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century plagued by this horrific action expressed his disgust on a canvas which later became a masterpiece known as Guernica.The mural Guernica represents suffering people, animals, and buildings wrenched by Nazi bombing and later earned the title Tortured Guernica.According to an eye witness's account which appeared in The New York Times on April 28, 1937 describes the heartbreaking events that occurred at the small Spanish town. The report follows thus.At 2 a.m. to-day when I visited the town the whole of it was a horrible sight, flaming from end to end.The reflection of the flames could be seen in the clouds of smoke above the mountains from 10 miles away.Throughout the night houses were falling until the streets became long heaps of red impenetrable debris. Many of the civilian survivors took the long trek from Guernica to Bilbao in antique solid-wheeled Basque farm carts drawn by oxen. Carts piled high with such household possessions as could be saved from the conflagration clogged the roads all night.Other survivors were evacuated in Government lorries, but many were forced to remain round the burning town lying on mattresses or looking for lost relatives and children, while units of the fire brigades and the Basque motorized police under the personal direction of the Minister of the Interior, Senor Monzon, and his wife continued rescue work till dawn.The indiscriminate killing of a large numbers of the Guernica civilians by the Luftwaffe Junkers aroused Pablo Picasso's artistic conscious. Small Spanish town of Guernica was not a militarily significant target. But in front of an immense military power a sense of justice and value of human lives became trivial.Picasso who was a genius of shape molded his artistic ability to send a message to the evil dowers as well as to the future generations who would learn by Guernica tragedy. Pablo Picasso's monumental painting The Tortured Guernica portrays an eternal anti war symbol.Although Picasso was a well-known artist but least understood so as his mural Guernica which carries artistic expressions of an enigmatic gesture.It is a black and grey picture without text which silently spoke thousand words. The picture contains images of a light bulb, a bull's head, a dying horse, a woman with outstretched arms, burning buildings, a warrior with a broken sword and an anguished mother with a dead child. Each image has a deep meaning and symbolizes the death, evil power, human despair and anguish.The content of Guernica was widely discussed by the Artistic community as well as Psychologists. Although the precise significance of the imagery in Guernica remains ambiguous Guernica challenges the 20th century notions of warfare and portrays it as a brutal act of violence and urge for self-destruction.Picasso seized the instinctive id impulses which comprise the unorganized part of the human personality structure that contains the basic drives.As the psychoanalytic notion the Id is the dark, inaccessible part of human personality or the savage part which becomes active in events like war. Sigmund Freud believed that the id represents biological instinctual impulses in men such as aggression (Thanotes or the Death instinct) and sexuality.Thanotes or the Death instinct is the foremost subject of the mural Guernica. Picasso's Guernica painting narrates the rhythm of death and human suffering. It reflects the unexpected change from life to death.The image of bulb on the top represents the bombs fell from the German Junkers which brought the message of death.The symbolic painting of the horrors: the fallen hero and anguish mother with her dead son, agonized horse, and the dead with widely opened eyes recount an outsized story.It is a form of indictment of man's inhumanity to man.The Tortured Guernica is a testament to Picasso's genius. The Guernica's concealed images of death are a prophetic vision of the modern warfare.The painting is an artistic metaphor for the human anguish under a deadly unleashed force the mankind ever saw.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at htsyndication@hindustantimes.comWord count: 792Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Among them, one small book and one very big one, both by scholars who have devoted years of study to Leonardo, stand out. ""Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing"" (Rizzoli Electa, 256 pages, $40) by Martin Clayton, is a model of clarity and concision. Leonardo's keen observation of humanity and nature, and his imaginative reach, are most evident in his drawings, and this exhibition catalog offers a way into his world. For the full picture, though, we can now turn to a monumental, four-volume set by Carmen C. Bambach, ""Leonardo da Vinci Rediscovered"" (Yale, 2,279 pages, $550). With 1,500 illustrations and thorough, scholarly analysis on every aspect of Leonardo's career, the set can be yours for the price of a small luxury handbag.While drawing was at the heart of Leonardo's achievement, it is no longer the foundation stone of art and architectural training. In architecture especially, a few decades after the advent of digital rendering, drawing is barely taught in schools. Fortunately, there are efforts to keep drawing alive not just as a means to communicate spontaneously‚Äîfor a quick sketch, nothing beats the cocktail napkin‚Äîbut also as a way to generate ideas and recording fleeting impressions. ""Architecture Through Drawing"" (Lund Humphries, 240 pages, $99.99), edited by Desley Luscombe, Helen Thomas and Niall Hobhouse, offers an excellent compendium of experimental sketches and finished drawings, alongside essays by architects, critics and scholars addressing the vitality and possibility of drawing for architecture now.Read More: Holiday Books Gift GuidePHOTO: Andrew BanneckerObservational drawing may have long ago lost its role as the starting point for a would-be artist. But there are few practices that have such an immediate cognitive effect. Start to draw and you start to see the world differently. ""Ways of Drawing"" (Thames & Hudson, 272 pages, $45), edited by Julian Bell, Julia Balchin and Claudia Tobin, assembles a wide range of recent work, together with essays and drawing exercises on the human form, the city and nature. There is much material here for art students, teachers, amateurs and enthusiasts.Drawing requires paper, a medium easily taken for granted. A short, well-designed and elegantly written book, ""The Art of Paper"" (Yale, 174 pages, $45) by Caroline Fowler takes us through the early history and development of the medium. Considering how paper was produced and traded, and how artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer exploited it as a vehicle for his ambitions, Ms. Fowler offers a lively account of why paper matters.The best museums and exhibitions ask us to rethink what we think we know. ""Caravans of Gold, Fragments of Time"" (Block Museum/Princeton, 311 pages, $65), edited by Kathleen Bickford Berzock, reconsiders the story of the medieval West by shifting the viewpoint substantially south, to the Sahara. Artifacts in ivory, copper, glass and gold, from human figures to drinking vessels, register the interactions between cultures on both sides of the Sahara.While some museums have sought to recast the canon, others write their own story altogether. The Studio Museum in Harlem, through the vision and energy of its director, Thelma Golden, has promoted a wide-ranging array of artists. ""Black Refractions"" (Rizzoli Electa, 232 pages, $45), edited by Ms. Golden, Connie H. Choi and Kellie Jones, encapsulates the rich and varied set of works by artists of African descent from the 1920s to the present.As art history expands its borders, it also returns and revises its earlier assumptions. In ""Veiled Presence"" (Yale, 224 pages, $55), Paul Hills presents a survey of Renaissance art through the lens of drapery, curtains and veils. It is the sort of surprising category that, once recognized, appears to permeate everything.In ""Roger Fry and Italian Art"" (Paul Holberton, 452 pages, $140), Caroline Elam considers one of the influential founders of the Burlington Magazine and a crucial figure in the Bloomsbury group. The book is split between a vivid picture of Fry's intellectual world and a selection of his still-resonant writings.In the modern era, Suzanne Preston Blier revisits one of Picasso's most famous works in ""Picasso's Demoiselles: The Untold Origins of a Modern Masterpiece"" (Duke, 448 pages, $29.95). As an Africanist, Ms. Blier reveals neglected aspects of the painting's history, from the sources of Picasso's masks to the identity of his models.Ms. Brothers is the author of ""Michelangelo, Drawing, and the Invention of Architecture.""Credit: By Cammy Brothers Word count: 747Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Few people know what kind of person he was when he was young, however, before fame and fortune found him.Fewer still are likely to know the artists with whom he spent time. Who knows the story behind how his ground-breaking Cubist work came to be born? All this and more can be found in ""Pablo."" Created by Belgian writer Julie Birmant and French artist Clement Oubrerie, this French-language comic strip explores the life of Picasso before he became known as the master of Cubism. Birmant discussed this unusual biography with The Daily Star.Q: How did you come up with the idea of creating a comic strip on Picasso?A: Chance, premonitions, friends' advice - I don't know. All I know is that [years back] I found myself ordering a book put in the backroom of the Clignancourt Library, entitled ""Souvenirs Intimes"" (Intimate Memories) by Fernande Olivier. From the very beginning, this woman in love attracted [my attention]. In her unfinished but intriguing book she spoke directly to me with her wild, refined, rough and sharp accent. In a nutshell, I fell under Fernande's charm. Her silences [titillated] my curiosity, and I wanted to understand what made her remember her history with Picasso as the most beautiful thing that happened to her, 40 years after they broke up.As my research progressed, I understood that Fernande had played an [important] role in the advancement of Cubism. Without her, ""Les Demoiselles D'Avignon"" wouldn't have existed. No one knew who she was. There was this [feeling of] urgency about giving her the place she deserved in the history of art.Writing about Fernande was about being an administrator of justice, since her memoirs had been banned for a long time. So I wrote this story with a lot of passion, and dreamed of finding an excellent artist to make a comic strip out of it. It was Clement Oubrerie, who was thrilled right away [by the project].Q: Are the graphics and texts [entirely] based on the research you did on Picasso? Or is everything from your own imaginations?A: Everything is real in this story. We wrote it based on testimonies and the works of the different characters.Q: Had you collaborated with Clement Oubrerie in the past?A: No, this is the first time. We knew of and appreciated each other's work, but it was through our editor from Dargaud, Gisele de Haan, that we met. We [liked] each other immediately.Q: March 21 marked the official release of the fourth and final volume ...A: Yes, that's right! The ""Pablo"" series - four tomes and close to 2,000 drawings in color on more than 300 pages - has come to an end. For three years, we impregnated ourselves with this story. We seized it with the audacity that came from our ignorance. We didn't know much, aside from a few cliches about famous people: Max Jacob, [Guillaume] Apollinaire, [Henri] Matisse, [Georges] Braque, Gertrude Stein, Picasso ...Q: How have you divided up Picasso's biography to fill multiple comics?A: The first tome - subtitled ""Max Jacob"" - tells how the poet fell crazy in love with the young Spanish man [Picasso] and how he helped him in the most difficult period of his life.The second one [""Apollinaire""] focuses on the close friendship between the two poorly loved artists. Apollinaire digs in his sadness for [the inspiration behind] his masterpiece ""La Chanson du Mal-Aime"" [The Song of the Poorly Loved] and he helped Picasso conquer Fernande.""Matisse"" - the third tome - shows how Picasso radically transformed his way of painting, inspired by Spanish [and] African primitives and by Oceania. He becomes an outstanding painter and means to supplant his biggest rival, Matisse.[As for] the fourth volume - entitled ""Picasso - it narrates how Picasso created ""Les Demoiselles D'Avignon,"" a gigantic canvas that he imagined as a response to Matisse's ""Bonheur de Vivre."" It is as provocative as an artistic manifesto.Q: Were you concerned about the audience's response to your comic strip, since it is one of a kind?A: Biopics are trendy nowadays. Therefore, many comic strips deal with historic figures.For us, the aim was to succeed in making the story and characters alive, while telling a crucial moment in the history of art:The birth of Cubism.Worries came [in the beginning]: Were we able to keep the bet? Drawing about Picasso, [writing] about his work, his loves, his friends, and being up to the task? It is up to the reader to judge.We took a lot of pleasure getting into ... the younger years of major artists. Let's hope that the audience will [enjoy] the fourth volume. Until now, we've been lucky - our books were appreciated by connoisseurs of Picasso, as well as by amateurs.Julie Birmant and Clement Oubrerie's ""Pablo"" is available on Amazon.Copyright ¬© 2014, The Daily Star.

There was no absolute confirmation of this, however, until now, Discovery News reported.Physicists at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill., trained their hard X-ray nanoprobe at Picasso's painting 'The Red Armchair,' completed in 1931, which they borrowed from the Art Institute of Chicago.The nanoprobe instrument can ""see"" details down to the level of individual pigment particles, revealing the arrangement of particular chemical elements in the paint.The analysis showed that Picasso used enamel paint that matches the precise chemical composition of the first brand of commercial house paint, called Ripolin.The researchers were able to compare the painting's pigment with those of paints available at the time by analyzing decades-old paint samples bought on eBay.What's more, the detailed study, which used X-rays to probe the painting's pigment down to the scale of 30 nanometers (a sheet of copier paper is 100,000 nanometers thick), was able to pinpoint the manufacturing region where the paint was made by studying its particular impurities.""The nanoprobe at the [Advanced Photon Source X-ray facility and the Center for Nanoscale Materials] allowed unprecedented visualization of information about chemical composition within a singe grain of paint pigment, significantly reducing doubt that Picasso used common house paint in some of his most famous works,"" one of the research leaders, Argonne's Volker Rose, said in a statement.Art scholars think Picasso experimented with Ripolin to achieve a different effect than would've been possible with traditional oil paints, which dry slowly and can be heavily blended.In contrast, house paint dries quickly and leaves effects like marbling, muted edges, and even drips of paint.

Q&A: 'Weekend With Pablo Picasso' creator Siguenza,Arizona Republic,26 Apr 2015,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitArizona Theatre Company's ""A Weekend With Pablo Picasso"" promises an up-close-and-personal look at the man many regard as the greatest painter of all time. How personal? Well, let's just say it answers that eternal question, ""Boxers or briefs?"" First produced in 2011 by the Alley Theatre in Houston, the one-man show stars actor-playwright Herbert Siguenza, one of the founding members of Los Angeles' Chicano theater troupe Culture Clash. It opens Saturday, May 2, at the Herberger Theater Center in Phoenix. Siguenza was inspired by photographer David Douglas Duncan's book ""The Private World of Pablo Picasso."" ""He had access to Picasso for six months and photographed him every day, working and eating and bathing and painting,"" Siguenza says. ""That book really had a great impact on me as a kid. I didn't know who Picasso was, really, but I just saw this man that I admired his lifestyle. He was the epitome of an artist, creating every day and just having fun doing it."" The show touches on some of the painter's historic works, particularly ""Guernica,"" as well as his famously volatile love life, but neither art history nor what Siguenza dismisses as ""gossip"" is the focus. Instead, the audience will see Picasso as raconteur, spinning stories about his life as an artist in Paris. ""He's calmed down,"" Siguenza says. ""He's now happily married. He has two kids, Claude and Paloma, and he's living in the south of France. He's made it already. He's a millionaire. He's already considered a legend and the father of modern art. So there's nothing for him to prove, and that's why I wanted to portray him at that point in his life. ""How does an artist keep creative and keep restless when he's already accomplished everything in life? That's what the play is really about."" Siguenza is also a painter, and the show features work he's done in Picasso's style, including some he creates live onstage. The show is definitely a labor of love. ""It's about Picasso, and yet it's about me as an artist too, in my mid-career,"" Siguenza says. ""Everything that he talks about in the play I totally endorse. I'm actually quoting things I totally agree with, and so the conviction is definitely there in the piece. ""Ultimately to really leave a legacy and to leave that amount of work behind, you really have to be fearlessly selfish, and I think he was. The work was his first love. That was the priority in his life. And, to a certain extent, I live that way. I'm a parent and a husband, but my family knows that my work is first, because that really is my life. That's the way I identify myself."" Reach the reporter at kerry.lengel@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

In a class at the company's internal training programme, the so-called Apple University, the instructor likened the 11 lithographs that make up Picasso's ""The Bull"" to the way Apple builds its smartphones and other devices. The idea: Apple designers strive for simplicity just as Picasso eliminated details to create a great work of art. Steve Jobs established Apple University as a way to inculcate employees into Apple's business culture and educate them about its history, particularly as the company grew and the tech business changed. Courses are not required, only recommended, but getting new employees to enroll is rarely a problem. Although many companies have such internal programmes, sometimes referred to as indoctrination, Apple's version is a topic of speculation and fascination in the tech world. It is highly secretive and rarely written about, referred to briefly in the biography of Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Apple employees are discouraged from talking about the company in general, and the classes are no exception. No pictures of the classrooms have surfaced publicly. And a spokeswoman for Apple declined to make instructors available for interviews for this article. But three employees who have taken classes agreed to speak to The New York Times on the condition that they not be identified. They described a programme that is an especially vivid reflection of Apple and the image it presents to the world. Like an Apple product, it is meticulously planned, with polished presentations and a gleaming veneer that masks a great deal of effort. ""Even the toilet paper in the bathrooms is really nice,"" one of the employees said. Unlike many corporations, Apple runs its training inhouse, year round. The full-time faculty - including instructors, writers and editors -create and teach the courses. Some faculty members come from universities like Yale, Harvard, the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford and MIT, and some continue to hold positions at their schools while working for Apple.Word count: 338Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

""It was because of something I wrote for the Observer , which he read in the French equivalent of the Reader's Digest . It was about his friendship with Braque and I mentioned that Picasso had offered him studio space at his place in Cannes, which Braque refused. Trivial enough, but it made him cross because he didn't want it known that anyone could say no to him! He never referred to it; [Jacqueline] ticked me off on his behalf. I did once see him being mean, when he turned up with Cocteau and all the hangers-on for dinner after a bullfight. Jacqueline looked ill, collapsed and I carried her upstairs. Picasso just shrugged and said, 'I seem to have a corpse on my hands.' She told me that she needed an operation - a hysterectomy, I suppose, though she was too ashamed to use the word - but couldn't have it because, '[Pablo] doesn't want to live with a eunuch'.""The purpose of women was clearly defined. What, I wondered, was the role of male admirers like Richardson? Did the master expect his companions to be slaves or, at least, feudal vassals? I asked about Picasso's assertion that ""to like my paintings, people really have to be masochists"". ""He probably said that for effect,"" Richardson retaliated. ""A day later he'd have been saying the opposite."" But another anecdote made me wonder about the psychodynamics of their association. Picasso often showed the young man sets of drawings, asking him to choose the best - significantly "" le plus fort "", never "" le plus beau "" - and always accepting his judgment.Paloma's cheekiest allusion to Picasso's legacy is the men's fragrance she called Minotaure, launched in 1992. The randy bull was one of his self-images and he often drew the horned Minotaur trampling sacrificial virgins beneath its hooves. Paloma's imaginary be ast is sweeter-smelling, less rapacious: ""I was thinking of the Mediterranean and of that scented darkness when I chose the name. It's an indirect allusion to my father, but it shows how inescapable he is!"" Richardson's biography argues that the purpose of Picasso's art is exorcism, the casting-out of evil, achieved by the black magic of his deformations. Paloma's perfume manages a milder exorcism of her father's influence, transforming the musky odour of rut into a gentler, more fetching olfactory aura.MoreYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But his flamboyant personality divided opinion. Was he a playful genius, as some suggest, or a capricious and cruel misanthrope who left battered lives in his wake? On the eve of a new show in London, we speak to his closest friends and family in a bid to unravel the enigma'Picasso,"" the surrealist poet Paul Eluard said, ""paints like God or the devil."" Picasso favoured the first option. ""I am God,"" he was once heard telling himself. He muttered the mantra three times, boasting of his power to animate and enliven the visible world. Any line drawn by his hand pulsed with vitality; when he looked at it, a bicycle seat and its handlebar could suddenly turn into the horned head of a bull. But he also took a diabolical pleasure in warping appearances, deforming faces and twisting bodies, subjecting reality to a tormenting inquisition.Picasso's behaviour was equally dualistic. In my recent conversations with people who knew him, I heard him compared to a saint, and was startled when a former model took him at his word and equated him with God. His biographer John Richardson, who lived near him in Provence during the 1950s, told me about the warmth and rollicking conviviality of the man: the genius was also genial. Others described a predator who gobbled up visual stimuli and wolfed down friends, employees and lovers.The Swiss dealer and collector Angela Rosengart, whose own Picassos are on display at her museum in Lucerne, remembered presenting him with some handmade drawing paper. He licked his lips as he appraised its possibilities: ""I'm a paper-eater, you know!"" he said. ""People were happy to be consumed by him,"" his daughter, Paloma, remarked. ""They thought it was a privilege. If you get too close to the Sun, it burns you. But the Sun can't help being the Sun.""""Reality must be torn apart,"" Picasso told Francoise Gilot, the young painter who met him in 1943 and, obeying his brusque instruction to prove her fertility, bore him two children, Paloma and her brother, Claude. After 10 years with him, Gilot wondered whether she, too, had been torn apart. As a painter and a sculptor, Picasso magically metamorphosed the things he saw; Gilot, in her book about their vexed partnership, felt that he had forced ""a metamorphosis in my nature"". He remade her to suit himself, then looked elsewhere when she had served her purpose, which was to fuel his creativity and cosset his ego.Unlike the rest of the many women in Picasso's life, Gilot took the initiative by leaving him. She survived; others, less lucky, were, as Richardson says in his biography, ""incinerated in the furnace of Picasso's psyche"". His neurotically jangled mistress Dora Maar, the weeping woman in the paintings of the late 1930s, was skewered by his cruelty. At lunch, Richardson recalled, Picasso might praise a painting by Maar and liken it to Cezanne, giddily elating her; at dinner, he would casually remark that Cezanne was shit and drop her back into self-doubt.Even after being replaced by Gilot, Maar was expected to remain available, forbidden to accept evening invitations in case Picasso whimsically decided to dine with her. She was not allowed to get over Picasso; his second wife, Jacqueline, a submissive helpmate but also a jealously protective guardian, could not forgive herself for surviving him. After his death in 1973, Jacqueline lapsed into an alcoholic fog, woozily communing with the spirit of the lord and master she addressed as ""Monseigneur"". Richardson remembered her in the mid-1980s stubbornly asserting: ""Pablo is not dead."" A year later, she shot herself.The suffering has persisted into the second and third generations, as the miserable end of Picasso's grandson Pablito demonstrates. The young man's father, Paulo, was born during Picasso's marriage to a Russian ballerina; emasculated and shiftless, Paulo served for a while as Picasso's chauffeur. Pablito, whose name marked him as a further diminutive of the glowering paterfamilias, tried to pay homage to Picasso the day after his death; the monopolistic Jacqueline had him expelled from the villa and decreed that he and the rest of Picasso's motley brood could not attend the funeral. Heartbroken by this rejection, Pablito downed a bottle of bleach. His sister, Marina, who has published a memoir denouncing their distant, coldly manipulative grandfather, found Pablito haemorrhaging his corroded intestines: talk about reality being torn apart!Jacqueline nudged Richardson to begin a biography, counting on him, as he said when we met in New York, to be ""discreet"". The undertaking has been a devotional act. Richardson began to worship Picasso when he first saw reproductions of his work in art magazines during his schooldays in the late 1930s. ""From the age of 13 to 15, I was obsessed by Picasso - and 10 years later I became his friend!""They met while Richardson was living with collector Douglas Cooper in a chateau they elaborately restored; the two men belonged to what Richardson calls Picasso's "" tertulia "". ""That's the word Spaniards use to describe a group of guys who meet in the cafe to discuss politics, women, sport. We didn't exactly do that. Most often, Douglas and I cooked dinners for Picasso and his entourage on their way home from the bullfights in Arles. Picasso often repaid our hospitality by bringing us drawings, though later he gave us caviar instead; he joked that now the prices for his art had risen so high, caviar was cheaper!""What Picasso demanded from his gang of companions was, as Richardson put it, ""fealty"". It is a revealingly antiquated word, remembering the vassal's obligation of fidelity to his feudal overlord. But can a biographer be so subservient?""I'm sure Picasso would have hated my books about him,"" said Richardson. ""He was secretive, he didn't want everything to be known. His affairs were the source for his work. Once, when he was showing me some portraits, he said, 'It must be awful for a woman to look at the way I paint her and see that she's about to be replaced.'""He did everything in his power to block the publication of Gilot's book in 1964 and when he failed he banished Paloma and Claude as revenge on their mother. Sometimes, the truth is unpleasant, but I don't hold with the way he's been demonised by feminist academics - denounced as a wife-beater and all the rest."" It was only too easy for Merchant and Ivory to cast Anthony Hopkins in Surviving Picasso , their slushy film about his relationship with Gilot; they relied on Hopkins to bring to the character the gloating, carnivorous guile he found in Hannibal Lecter.""Picasso could be ferocious,"" said Richardson, ""but he was also gentle, sweet, child-like. Dora Maar used to talk about his persecution of her, but when she had a breakdown and got religion, she took to calling him the apostle who regenerated art. After all, she'd been the mistress of Georges Bataille, the most way-out of the surrealists, a real satanist, in love with evil and erotic pain. So life with Picasso must have been a bed of roses after the bed of thistles she shared with Bataille!""Richardson has likened Picasso to Frankenstein, who, defying God's creative primacy, soldered corpses together; his portrait of Gertrude Stein, for instance, grafts on to her mask-like head the face of a nonagenarian smuggler Picasso met during a Spanish holiday. ""He had a Dracula side as well,"" Richardson told me. ""He fed on those around him, like a vampire sucking life out of his victims. He once said something very telling about the fans, stalkers, autograph-seekers, dealers, collectors and paparazzi: 'These people cut me up like a chicken on the dinner table. I nourish them, but who nourishes me?'""We all donated our energy, if not our blood. If there were six or eight people for lunch, he'd get every single one - he'd seize control of you, turn you inside out. The pretty girls he'd flatter and flirt with. If there were kids present, he'd make toys for them or do drawings. Even animals weren't immune - he'd entice them to come to him. Everyone had to be seduced. You ended the day completely drained. But he'd imbibe all that stolen energy and stride off into the studio and work all night. I can't imagine the hell of being married to him!""Douglas Cooper fell from grace after he presumed to plead the cause of the excommunicated Paloma and her brother. ""That was absurd,"" said Richardson, who re-enacted the scene for me with a satirical glee. ""Nothing could have infuriated Picasso more than trying to get him to recognise his illegitimate children as heirs - not for financial reasons, but because any mention of a will reminded him of death, which his art was so determined to deny. Douglas was thrown out, but wouldn't give up. There was a steep flight of stairs leading down from Picasso's villa to the front gate and poor Douglas paused on every step, kneeling and weeping and grovelling and begging to be forgiven! It did him no good at all.""Richardson felt Picasso's muffled annoyance only indirectly. ""It was because of something I wrote for the Observer , which he read in the French equivalent of the Reader's Digest . It was about his friendship with Braque and I mentioned that Picasso had offered him studio space at his place in Cannes, which Braque refused. Trivial enough, but it made him cross because he didn't want it known that anyone could say no to him! He never referred to it; Jacqueline ticked me off on his behalf. I did once see him being mean, when he turned up with Cocteau and all the hangers-on for dinner after a bullfight. Jacqueline looked ill, collapsed and I carried her upstairs. Picasso just shrugged and said, 'I seem to have a corpse on my hands.' She told me that she needed an operation - a hysterectomy, I suppose, though she was too ashamed to use the word - but couldn't have it because, 'Pablo doesn't want to live with a eunuch'.""The remark poignantly acknowledged Jacqueline's sense of her duty (and of her failure to fulfil it, since she did not add to Picasso's eclectic crop of children). He was a creator; his women had a lowlier responsibility, serving as reproductive vehicles. ""Of course,"" Richardson added, ""it was just the idea of having offspring that appealed to him. In practice, he expected the current woman in his life to be at his beck and call, so he begrudged time spent on maternal chores. He could be a doting father. He loved devising games, teaching them to draw, romping on the beach. But his work had priority and then he didn't want to be bothered.""The purpose of women was clearly defined. What, I wondered, was the role of male admirers like Richardson? Did the master expect his companions to be slaves or, at least, feudal vassals? I asked about Picasso's assertion that ""to like my paintings, people really have to be masochists"". ""He probably said that for effect,"" Richardson retaliated. ""A day later he'd have been saying the opposite."" But another anecdote made me wonder about the psychodynamics of their association. Picasso often showed the young man sets of drawings, asking him to choose the best - significantly "" le plus fort "", never "" le plus beau "" - and always accepting his judgment.""I was so amazed by his interest in what I felt that I got teary-eyed! When it happened more than once, I began to suspect he was playing a trick on me, so I asked, 'Hey, Pablo, what's up?' He said, 'There was only one other person I could make cry like that.' I badgered him to tell me who it was and then he changed the subject because he'd given away too much.""The other lachrymose acolyte was Georges Bemberg, the unstable son of a brewing tycoon, who claimed to be Picasso's protege. When he went mad, his family covered its embarrassment by pretending that he was dead. Almost 50 years later, Picasso was asked to sign some drawings that Bemberg had owned. He reacted to the imitative doodles with horror and superstitious alarm, yelling: ""Don't touch them, they're the drawings of a madman!"" Picasso enjoyed adoration, but reviled followers who drew too close to the sacred fire.Richardson has so far survived Picasso, but the race is not yet over. He has spent almost 40 years on the biography, though the three volumes published so far have only reached the middle of Picasso's life. ""I'm 85 and I don't have all that much time. The biography grew at its own pace, which is why it has taken so long. There has to be a fourth volume, maybe a fifth - who knows? I suffer from wet macular degeneration and I need an injection in my eyeball once a month. I'm fine in front of paintings, but I have a problem with print, so research is hard.""The contrast with Picasso's ebullient, often riotously obscene, old age is clear enough. Angela Rosengart told me, with some genteel euphemisms, about a conversation she overheard between Picasso and the equally ancient pianist Artur Rubinstein. She at first described the talk as ""boyish""; when I pressed her for details, she said: ""Oh dear, they were telling their dreams and they were so indecent!""Genius, for Picasso, was lecherous adolescence recovered at will. Richardson is less frisky, but keeps going with a gallant, generous stoicism. He is currently preparing a New York exhibition of Picasso's last works - paintings of a muddled rabble of musketeers, whores, thieves and beggars, with faces scavenged from Rembrandt, Velazquez and Goya. ""By the end of his life, he knew he couldn't compete with the avant-garde. Americans had taken over, bringing back the abstraction that he always despised. But he turned the studio in his last house into a microcosm, projected slides sent from the Louvre on the walls, and shut himself away to cannibalise the entire history of art. It was a triumphant end to his career, not a falling-off.""I couldn't help comparing the clutter of Picasso's working space, strewn with relics, fetishes, props for his dressing-up games and the dung of his pet goat, with the gilded trophies and pedestalled neoclassical busts in Richardson's princely pad at the bottom end of Fifth Avenue. The artist, working like a cyclone, throve in chaos; his biographer, with a tidier mind, is slowly imposing order on Picasso's rackety life and refuses to rush to judgment before his knowledge of the subject is complete. I hope the tortoise catches up with the hare at the finishing line.When we met in Lausanne, Paloma Picasso told me about being present, as a quiet and unobtrusive child, during sessions of almost frenetic creativity in the studio. ""He was 67 when I was born, but I never thought of him as old. He was so vital, so playful. Perhaps he thought of me as a contemporary, even though I was only four when my mother took my brother and me away to live in Paris in 1953. He was proud to draw like a child, not someone with an academic training.""One day, I got a pair of white espadrilles. I was so happy, they looked so cute, I'd wanted them so much. And the moment my father saw them he covered the canvas with red and blue designs. They looked fabulous, they'd become an art object, but it was a little sad too; I realised I'd never ever be able to have white espadrilles like the other girls!""Even when taking a rest or pausing to entertain his daughter, Picasso could not help littering the world with more art. ""All day long while he worked, he smoked - first Gauloises, then Gitanes. The cigarettes came in little cardboard cartons and whenever he finished a packet, which was three or four times a day, he'd cut it up to make me a doll or a finger puppet or scribble a pencil drawing on it. He couldn't stop himself.""Angela Rosengart remembers a similar overflow of inventiveness. Arranging for her to visit him next day with her father, Picasso drew them two tickets of admission, decorated with a sketch of Rembrandt and a scribbled signature. They gained entry to Picasso's presence by showing these little Picassos (which they were allowed to keep).Jean Cocteau thought that Picasso had ""terrible eyes that pierced like gimlets""; Richardson thinks of him as a witch doctor with the gift of x-ray vision that Andalusians call the mirada fuerte - a strong gaze that penetrates objects. The black eyes inherited by Paloma are less baleful and they shone with delight as she remembered a world in which daily reality consisted of dreams and games.""We had a menagerie in the house. My father was like St Francis of Assisi - animals couldn't resist his aura. A goat called Esmeralda had the run of the villa, it lived upstairs with us. My mother gave away an earlier Esmeralda to some gypsies because she hated its smell and the mess it made; my father was outraged and said he loved the goat like a child. He even sculpted it, with cardboard ears, a basket for its belly, udders made of terracotta milk jugs and a metal pipe sticking out for its anus. This one was the second Esmeralda and it was lonely. It cried at night and I'd go and goat-sit to comfort it. Often, I fell asleep beside it.""One summer, a frog hopped out of the pond and came and sat with us on the steps in the evening when it was cool. My father constructed a little ladder so it could climb up and get into the house. We gave it a bowl to live in, but it couldn't feed itself in there. My father collected flies for it; he had a way of gently sweeping the air with his open hand and then closing it on the insects. Even the flies weren't afraid of him!""Paloma illustrated the gesture for me, but the clatter of her gold-bangled wrist and the flash of her jewel-studded fingers would have scared off any swarms. Even so, I saw what trust her father must have had in the strength and stealth of his hand, which he relied on to make instantaneous decisions about marking canvas or modelling clay.During the 1950s, Paloma and Claude travelled down from Paris to the Midi to spend their holidays with Picasso. ""He played the role of father when he met the train and asked us about school. But he really didn't care and admitted that he'd been a bad student himself. His father was a colombophile who allowed him to take his doves to school and you can imagine how that disrupted lessons! By the end of the day, our games would resume.""The idyll ended with the publication of Gilot's Life With Picasso in 1964. Rosengart remembered his reaction when he read the French translation. ""He gripped my shoulder and said, 'How could a woman do such a thing?' That shows, you see, what respect he had for women!""I begged to differ; the remark called Gilot a disgrace to her gender because of her independence. When Picasso first met Gilot, he'd proposed keeping her captive in an attic, swaddled like a Muslim woman, until he was ready to unwrap her for delectation; early in his friendship with Rosengart, he said that he fancied detaining her on the premises as a perpetually available model.""The book was not harmful,"" Paloma insisted. ""The art world deified my father and my mother wrote about him as a human being - about his little quirks and superstitions, but also about his attempts to control her. Anyway, Jacqueline used the book as the excuse for a breach with us. From now on, we officially didn't exist, we couldn't be mentioned, we were bad. But how evil can you be when you're only 14? Maybe Jacqueline resented us because she gave him no children.""Once, during the time we were banned, I saw my father in Cannes. I rushed up to him, we embraced as if nothing had ever happened. Should I have told him that I'd been to the house every day that week, but was not allowed in? I didn't want to ruin the moment with accusations. Then Jacqueline bustled up and bundled him into the car. She must have been very insecure, which is maybe why she couldn't survive him.""Picasso died intestate, forcing Paloma and Claude to apply to the French courts for recognition as his descendants and heirs; eventually, a legal ruling allowed them to adopt the surname Ruiz-Picasso. The hyphen ironically disinterred the conflicts of previous generations. Ruiz was their father's patronymic, which he spurned as a means of separation from his own father, a tamely realistic painter; he called himself Picasso after his mother's family.But the famous name that Paloma coveted carried its own burden. ""Both my parents were artists, so what else could I be? When the estate was settled, each of us - me, my brother and the step-siblings from other relationships - was allowed to choose a group of his works, within certain financial limits. And then we were involved in setting up the Musee Picasso in the Marais, which took care of the death duties. After you've been looking at Picassos all day, you don't want to come home and pick up a pen or a brush! Although I started to design jewellery before he passed away, for a long while I felt inhibited. How could I measure up?""She soon found an independent way to merchandise the family brand, and, following the example of the ceramics her father turned out in multiple editions in the 1950s, supplied the market with her own relatively affordable Picassos: jewellery, cosmetics, leather goods, sunglasses, china, tiles, furniture covers and wallpaper. Her father, to keep from being idle, sometimes manufactured such accessories. A couple of years before his death, he spotted a brass pendant dangling from Angela Rosengart's belt. He asked to borrow it and kept it for months. Long after she'd resolved to forget about it, he returned it gilded and engraved with the head of a baroque cavalier and personally dedicated to Rosengart.Paloma's cheekiest allusion to Picasso's legacy is the men's fragrance she called Minotaure, launched in 1992. The randy bull was one of his self-images and he often drew the horned Minotaur trampling sacrificial virgins beneath its hooves. Paloma's imaginary be ast is sweeter-smelling, less rapacious: ""I was thinking of the Mediterranean and of that scented darkness when I chose the name. It's an indirect allusion to my father, but it shows how inescapable he is!"" Richardson's biography argues that the purpose of Picasso's art is exorcism, the casting-out of evil, achieved by the black magic of his deformations. Paloma's perfume manages a milder exorcism of her father's influence, transforming the musky odour of rut into a gentler, more fetching olfactory aura.Psychologically, Paloma also learnt from his example. Paparazzi besieged the hospital in which she was born and dispatched nurses to bribe her mother; her infancy and childhood were remorselessly documented, since Picasso, as Richardson said, was ""as famous as a rock star"".Richardson regretted Picasso's antics for the camera. ""He played the fool, dressed up, performed little mimes, though often it was his only way of communicating with people. After the war, it was compulsory for Americans visiting Paris to call on him. They spoke no French, he spoke no English, so he had to put on these foolish dumb shows with silly hats or Indian head-dresses, like the one Gary Cooper gave him.""Paloma took a different, wilier view. ""My father didn't deny his celebrity. He treated the press the way you would do a dog - if you run away, it will chase you and bite you, but if you play with it, it may lick your hand."" Paloma developed her own sly version of this tactic and, like her friend Andy Warhol, she became socially and commercially ubiquitous while remaining unknowable.""I was so timid,"" she sighed. ""That's why I played the part of that lustful lesbian Hungarian countess in the film Immoral Tales ; I thought that would cure my shyness! When I began designing, I diverted attention to my persona, to the extravagant way I dressed or the fire-engine-red lipstick I wore. The look was a mask like those my father collected and I hid behind it.""Her current disguise is an immaculate anonymity. Sitting opposite me on a sofa in the Lausanne hotel, she could have been any prosperous, well-tended Swiss matron, except when the gold hoops rattled on her wrists and her father's eyes scorched me like a pair of black suns. More than 50 years after she first posed for Picasso, Angela Rosengart recalled with an excited shudder the raking scrutiny of those eyes. ""They burned,"" she said. ""He ate me with his eyes; you could feel him swallowing whatever he looked at. It was terrifying, exhausting, to sit there for two hours being looked at in that way, as if he were shooting arrows into me. I only really understood it much later when I read in John Richardson's book about the mirada fuerte .""Richardson, I noted, calls that unblinking gaze ""an ocular rape"". ""No, I never felt threatened,"" said Rosengart. ""Picasso was always so kind to me, so tender. And my father took photographs throughout the sessions, though he had to do so from the next room. First, Picasso made a pencil drawing, then next time a linocut, later a lithograph and aquatint - the same face, but always in a different medium, which shows how he liked to change people as he worked on them.""I would never have asked him for a portrait. Helena Rubinstein did that. She annoyed him so much that finally he gave in and did a whole series of drawings. They made her look so horrible that he never showed them to her.""Rubinstein, the magnate who invented anti-wrinkle creams, appears in Picasso's sketches as a cadaverous crone with gnarled, bejewelled knuckles; Angela Rosengart, so deferential and undemanding, looks wide-eyed with joy and gratitude in his portraits of her. ""A Spanish art critic told me that Picasso's first little girlfriend was called Angela and I remember once when he introduced me to someone he said, 'Elle s'appelle Angela' and repeated the name as if he was caressing me. Perhaps I was a souvenir of that first love - an innocent one, I hope! Anyway, that's how I crept into immortality through the back door.""Another young woman inadvertently immortalised by her brief contact with Picasso was 19-year-old Sylvette David, who posed for him in the summer of 1953. She caught his eye when her boyfriend tried to sell him some shakily assembled cubist chairs; soon she was visiting the studio every day.David - today called Lydia Corbett after a failed second marriage to an Englishman and a rebaptism following her religious conversion - lives in rural Devon. Stark trees in mucky fields creaked as gales lashed them, ragged clouds hurtled across the sky and rooks screeched imprecations. ""Provence is nicer, non ?"" said the erstwhile Sylvette as she surveyed the unmeridional weather.Picasso fancied Sylvette because she had a ponytail. ""He was fascinated by that. It was my father's idea; he liked the way ballerinas pulled their hair back. And no one ever had such a high ponytail as mine! Even Brigitte Bardot decided to copy my hair when she saw me on the Croisette in Cannes. Of course, she wasn't naturally blonde, like me!""Sylvette's fetishistic handful of hair has gone, replaced by Lydia's long yellow bangs. As a remembrance of the ponytail, however, she had twined a few strands into braids, with red wisps of ribbon knotted around them. ""It is the colour of the passion of Christ,"" she told me, fingering the ribbon. Then, less mystically solemn, she added: ""My grand-daughter likes to pull my braids."" Was this, I wondered, a dare?Francoise Gilot, preparing to walk out on Picasso in 1953, thought he was using Sylvette to make her jealous and scoffed at his claim that the girl had ""very pictorial features"". My view is that the ponytail lifted her face, pulled the skin taut and revealed sculptural planes.Picasso began with delicately accurate sketches of her, then in the next few months experimentally racked and twisted her body, finally remaking her in folded metal or casting her in bronze as his Woman With a Key , a statue originally pieced together from fire-clay bricks and other implements from a potter's kiln.A monolithic Sylvette, with her adamantine ponytail set in concrete, stands in the grounds of New York University, inflated from Picasso's original by Norwegian sculptor Carl Nesjar. ""Ah,"" said Lydia, showing me a dogeared photo album, ""I have never seen it, no one invites me to New York! Could you write that I would like to go?"" If my hair had been braided, I'm sure I would have felt a persuasive tweak.Lydia looked back with a teasing grin on the erotic imbroglio that surrounded Sylvette. ""I was in the middle of two women - Francoise and Jacqueline - and they didn't like me being there. Oh la la, it was difficult! Picasso often painted me in a rocking chair. You see it again in his portraits of Jacqueline, but I sat in it first! After a while, she made sure I wasn't welcome. Finally, she presented me with a book about his art, which he inscribed to me. That was her way of saying, 'It's over, go.' She had no need to worry; I was very pudique , not like the girls today.""Later I heard that the statue of me as the woman with the key was called The Brothel-Keeper and I was so offended. Who would say that about me? Maybe Jacqueline! Once he did offer me money to pose, but I refused. I thought, what if he wants me to be nude? He was 73 then, he wore slippers. But he was clean, he had no whiskers and he smelled nice, not of wine and garlic! He went back to his youth through me. He gave me a cuddle sometimes, like a good old dad.""I was not so sure, listening to Lydia's account of Sylvette's induction, that Picasso's intentions were paternal. He took her to his bedroom and bounced encouragingly on the bed. Instead of following his example, she marvelled at the agility of his ageing limbs. Then he led her to the stables, where his favourite Hispano-Suiza limousine was housed.""He opened the back door of the car and said, 'Come in.' I thought, 'That's a bit funny', but all we did was sit there, with an imaginary chauffeur in the front. We just talked."" About what? I asked. ""Oh, he told me that creativity was happiness, other things like that. His Spanish accent was so strong, often I couldn't understand what he was saying!""Despite Jacqueline's rebuff, Sylvette survived Picasso. Indeed he subsidised her after-life by presenting her with one of his 40 paintings of her, which she sold to buy an apartment in Paris.An illustrated children's book by her friend Laurence Anholt narrates her story as a fable of rebirth: Sylvette, surveying the Eiffel Tower from an eyrie paid for with a Picasso, embarks on an artistic career with the old master's encouragement and also manages, thanks to his avuncular ministrations, to overcome the trauma of abuse in childhood by her mother's bullying lover.Divine intervention also did its bit. ""After my first husband betrayed me, I was so hurt, so destroyed. But suddenly I was surrounded by a light, I felt happy, and I started singing in Latin about the pure in heart. That was God's gift to me!"" Another exorcism had occurred, this time with the aid of celestial grace, not Picasso's demonic conjuring.It is fitting that Picasso's place in Sylvette's life was taken by the only creative force he viewed as an equal. "" Ah oui ,"" said Lydia, fingering the ribbon that was her memento of Christ's blood, ""perhaps God sent me to Picasso to cheer him up and sent him to me to heal my hurt. God is in everybody. Those dark eyes Picasso had - that was God looking at me!""She showed me one of her recent watercolours, influenced more by Chagall than by Picasso. Against a gold background like that of a religious icon, Sylvette floats among a collection of Picasso's props - owls, masks, statuettes - with a cowled monk representing his better self; the painter's round face is lunar and those omniscient eyes keep protective watch on the world. ""He's so big he envelops us all,"" said Lydia, as if he were about to materialise in the room.I wondered, however, why she had given Picasso three arms, which reach out to pinion the airborne Sylvette. His extra, exploratory hand seemed bent on mischief. Was Picasso a deity or a randy old devil? Or perhaps, as Eluard suggested, both at once? According to John Richardson: ""The man was a paradox. Whatever you say about him, the reverse is also true."" His lovers, friends, models and children know that he metamorphosed them. Whether they were recreated or destroyed, even they can't be sure.Picasso: Challenging the Past is at the National Gallery, London, 25 February-7 June, sponsored by Credit Suisse.John Richardson's A Life of Picasso, Volume III: The Triumphant Years 1917-1932 was published in paperback last week.IllustrationCaption: article-conrad.picasso.1Word count: 5674Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Do you think I can sleep with crucified Christ?"" It is told Picasso said this to Francoise Gilotte just before they separated after 14 years of life together and two children. Picasso who could be harsh and insensitive to women at times also loved them and depicted them in various states in his great works. A contradiction that was a hallmark of his life and works.The creator of the greatest masterpieces like Guernica and the revolutionary cubist work Les demoiselles d' Avignon that was first called the philosophical brothel, was indeed, a poet too. He wrote poems when he was unable to paint or sculpt. It was more of his frustration pouring in verses when he was inactive. It was in an uncontrollable rush those poems came to him. He wrote those down in his sketch books. We are familiar with Picasso's use of visual metaphor bringing an object in place of other that is truly poetic and intensely influenced by Surreal approach. His poetry has resemblance to the consciousness writing of James Joyce whose juxtaposition of objects and nightmarish visions again reflect the surrealistic moment of the 30s.In his younger days, Picasso's and his friends' favourite hangout in Barcelona was a cafe Ells Quatre Gats, that was also a venue for the display of his early academic works influenced by his father Ruize Picasso. A lot of writers and poets among his friends spent their time discussing art and literature. They even published a magazine Quatre Gats. Picasso was very close with James Sabartes, a poet. Picasso moved to Paris determined to make it big. It is here he met Max Jacob, the Jewish poet who became a dear friend. Jacob introduced him to works of poets like Paul Verlaine and Alfred de Vigny and others. Guillame Appolinair and Andrew Salmon joined them later and helped to widen Picasso's horizon on literature, opera and theatre.Though Picasso didn't write poetry till the beginning of his 50th year, his involvement in poetry was as much as with his painting and sculpture. The visual dimensions where he often ignores the traditional grammar and vocabulary that has contributed to a new dimension in the contemporary art scene is reflected in his poems. The street full of stars/And the prisoners eat doves/And the doves eat cheese/And the cheese eat words/And the words eat bridges/And the bridges eat looks...These lines show that he never bothered about punctuations and notions of grammar as generally practised. He wrote in Spanish and French and was searching for visual dimensions rather than poetic descriptions. There are many artists who got engrossed in literary activity. Michelangelo wrote poems.In most cases, the line between visual dimensions and literary descriptions is very thin. It is often a fusion of both we experience in their writings. They do not seek separate creative identity in their activities, whether it is writing a line or drawing a picture. It is with the same zeal and enthusiasm they attempt both. A pen or brush-it doesn't make any difference to them. Both are spiritual activities where they converse with God; their questions for God on creativity. When God answers, they become beautiful creations. Every brush stroke, chisel cut or words they attempt are questions. With God's answers juxtaposed, they become divine creations.- Arakkal is a renowned artistPublished by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at htsyndication@hindustantimes.comWord count: 605Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Picasso.Mania, which opened on Wednesday, has brought together work by some of the most renowned contemporary artists and filmmakers, from David Hockney and Jasper Johns to Roy Lichtenstein, Jeff Koons and Jean-Luc Godard, to trace how the impact of Picasso's work goes far beyond the realm of visual art -- and can still be felt to this day. The blockbuster autumn exhibition, which features 78 artists, is centred around three pivotal moments in the Spanish artists's life: cubism; his works from the late 1930s when he first created his archetypal image of the turned face; and his late works, which were exhibited in the 1970s in Avignon. It also focuses on the lasting cultural legacy of Picasso's most emblematic works: Guernica and Les Demoiselles D'Avignon. Didier Ottinger, who curated the exhibition, admitted it was one of the most ambitious shows staged at the Grand Palais and had taken three years to pull off. He said: ""The purpose was to study the legacy of Picasso, not just through visual art but also through cinema, through music and even advertising, which is something huge because Picasso seems to be everywhere. We wanted to emphasise this very specific dimension of Picasso, which is that he is not only a painter but a man responsible for incarnating the genius of the 20th and now 21st century."" Unlike the 20 or so visual art exhibitions that have been staged since 1973 exploring the influence on Picasso on contemporary art, Picasso.Mania has a strong multimedia focus, including Hockney's 2012 video piece The Jugglers, a 2009 video installation by Rineke Dijkstra and clips from Godard's film Breathless. A brand new photo and digital work by Hockney, titled A Bigger Card Players, is also on display. Elements of the exhibition explore legacies such as the enduring image of Picasso's own face in art, including Maurizio Cattelan's kitsch larger-than-life fibreglass sculpture of Picasso, as well as the continued political significance of Guernica, symbolised by its transposition onto a tapestry now on the walls of the UN security council building. The premise of the show was risky, said Ottinger, because there was a chance artists would not want their work directly compared with Picasso. However, as George Condo, the American painter who has 17 works adorning the final wall of the exhibition, said, it was ""great to be recognised on such a level and hung next to an artist who you love"". Condo's recognisable paintings, which feature figures with grotesque expressions and cartoonish, exaggerated features, are often directly compared to Picasso's later figurative work. The works Condo chose to put in the show all feature naked figures with voluptuous flesh and all seemingly engaged in erotic and carnal activities, including two previously unseen paintings done just for the show. ""I wanted to draw all the unabashed, hysterical eroticism that we could possibly get out of my paintings,"" said Condo. ""I think Picasso in the last few years of his life became obsessive about it all, so I wanted to curate a body of my own work that would relate to that, which was both erotic but also insane, and really exhibit this mania. Those paintings are projections of a life I would never dare to live in my own true self."" Condo recalled his first encounter with Picasso in 1969, age 13, when he saw a picture of one of his paintings in the newspaper. The only art he was familiar with up to that point was religious images in churches and he was so intrigued he went out and bought a book on Picasso, which was his first introduction to modern art. Picasso's willingness to shock and ""cannibalise"" the Old Masters has also been an influence on Condo, who, thanks both to his grotesque portrait of the Queen and his provocative cover for Kanye West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, is no stranger to controversy. ""If I don't shock myself I consider it to be not a very good painting,"" he said. ""When Picasso did Les Demoisselles d'Avignon people thought it was a disgrace, and it was the same with the album cover I did for Kanye. It depicted an interracial couple naked, and there was this political backlash."" However, Condo said he hoped the show would also make people realise that while Picasso was an inspiration in his painting, his work was not simply a copy or bastardisation of the artist. ""Whereas something like the Roy Lichtenstein is a real knock-off of Picasso, there's actually no pure reference to Picasso in any of my works,"" he said. ""I thought that this show would clarify the differences between his work and mine, more than the similarities. That would be the ironic result of it all -- that finally people will stop saying 'oh it looks so much like Picasso'.""

Abstract,,,,"Based on the provided news article content, I would classify the impact on Pablo Picasso's reputation, visibility, and market confidence as ""High."" The article mentions the artist's name and works in the context of a new exhibition, which suggests that the coverage is likely to enhance his reputation in the art world. Additionally, the potential for increased visibility among collectors, galleries, and the general public is high due to the mention of the upcoming exhibition. The article also has the potential to boost market confidence in the artist's work as a sound investment, as it highlights recent skyrocketing sales of his works. Overall, the content suggests elements that could drive speculative buying and increase demand for Picasso's works, leading to a high impact on his reputation and market confidence.",,High,1.0

Pablo Picasso once visited Sheffield and left behind one of his most famous artworks - here's the inside story,The Star,11 Nov 2020,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitIt must be one of the greatest photo opportunities ever in Sheffield ‚Äì the moment artistic genius and committed pacifist Pablo Picasso stepped off a train at the Midland railway station to attend a conference in the city on world peace.The pioneering Spanish painter was greeted with a bunch of flowers when he disembarked from his carriage in November 1950. He was caught on camera holding the blooms while wearing a smart beret and a raincoat ‚Äì what is less well-known is that, moments later, he was sheepishly asked to hand the flowers back as they were needed to welcome other guests.Thousands of officials from around the globe were invited to Sheffield to make a plan for global harmony at the World Peace Congress from November 13 to 19. However, the UK Government refused visa entries for hundreds of people fearing it would cause unrest in the industrial city.Angela Martin, of Sheffield Creative Action for Peace, said: ‚ÄúSheffield went all out to prepare for the Congress despite the destruction left by World War Two and the fact rationing was still in place.‚ÄùA marquee big enough to allow 1,700 people to sit down and eat together was erected on a bombsite at West Bar, with flooring, plumbing and gas stoves. It cost ¬£4,000 then - equal to ¬£138,000 today.In the City Hall, 2,845 pairs of earphones were temporarily installed to allow the translation of speeches into six languages.Accommodation had been found, mostly in Leeds hotels, and 64 coaches booked for the 90-minute journey there and back. Most of this preparation was done by volunteers.However, the Government had other ideas.Their decision to undermine the Congress by refusing visas to most of the delegates seems to have come from a fear of its assumed trouble-making in this large industrial city.""That fear needs to be seen in the context of the time,‚Äù explained Angela. ‚ÄúIn 1950, five years after the end of the Second World War, including, of course, the considerable damage to Sheffield, the world‚Äôs people were hungry for peace.‚ÄùDespite the League of Nations being set up in 1920 ‚Äì following the end of the First World War in 1918 and the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919 ‚Äì its Covenant of Peace did not prevent armed conflict, and in 1946 its powers and functions were transferred to the newly formed United Nations.Whatever their achievements, neither had been able to achieve or sustain peace, said Angela, and the wars with Germany and Japan had resulted in millions of deaths.Many recognised the tragic irony that the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed 180,000 people, was supposedly ‚Äòthe only way to end‚Äô the war, she said.And in 1950 there was the threat of yet more war, this time in Korea, and there was growing hostility between America and Russia ‚Äì hostility which was leading to the Cold War with its tensions between East and West.""This might explain the British Government‚Äôs hostility to the second congress being held in Sheffield,‚Äù Angela said. ‚ÄúIt was convinced that the expected ‚Äòaliens‚Äô - the delegates to the Congress - could foment revolution amongst the huge workforce of steel workers and miners. Refusing visas to enter the country was the only legal way to prevent it.""The much-depleted event took place nevertheless, and Picasso was the star. He‚Äôd arrived at a station surrounded by streets of tiny terraced houses, frequently covered in industrial smog, and was met by trade unionists Bill Ronksley and Bas Barker.He left behind his Dove of Peace drawing, of which he made two on napkins ‚Äì one in Butler‚Äôs Dining Rooms on Brook Hill, and the other while returning to London. He gave the latter to the bodyguard who accompanied him around Sheffield, and the sketch is now part of Museums Sheffield‚Äôs collection.In the end, the second Congress reconvened, moved fairly quickly to Warsaw in Poland where there was more support for its aims and a full and official welcome.And Bas Barker, a lifelong member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, considered ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô at the time, was granted, many years later, the Freedom of the Borough of Chesterfield for his services to the town.Angela added: ‚ÄúThis is an important part of Sheffield‚Äôs history and of the continuing need for an active governmental Commitment to world peace without arms sales or destructive weaponry.""Sheffield Creative Action for Peace plans to mount a more public commemoration of this 1950 event, next year, when we will hopefully be out of lockdown and we would love to hear about any personal or family memories, stories, memorabilia you may have of the planning of the Congress, its truncated meeting ‚Äì and, of course, about Picasso and his doves.‚ÄùAnyone with information they want to share should contact peacecongress1950@gmail.comWord count: 809Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

He lived in the 20th century, the first century of global mass publicity. But he had everything. He was a child prodigy. He worked in every medium. He invented or inspired most modern art styles - Cubism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism. He had genius eyes, unflagging testosterone and political engagement ('Guernica'). His work was never really popular, not like Van Gogh's or Dali's. In recent decades his art influence has run out, replaced by Marcel Duchamp's.

At the start of the 18th century, Alexander Pope wrote a bad dream about household objects. ""Unnumber'd throngs, on ev'ry side are seen/ Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen / Here living Tea-pots stand, one arm held out/ One bent; the handle this, and that the spout...""A teapot metamorphosed into a person? Nothing new, and nothing simpler. Folk art has known these tricks down the ages. They appear again in Walt Disney. Humans can find their images almost anywhere.But then our standards are often not very exacting. Arms are a bonus. Our basic human model is a simple two-part thing, an object that hints at a head and a body, a pair of joined unequal units, that's all you need. A demijohn. A hand-bell. A spoon. An unusual pebble. Just add eyes.The transformation can play in opposite directions. You can see a human likeness as liberating a simple object, conferring character on it, releasing it into life. Or you can see a human form being imprisoned within an object, reduced down to a limit state of simplification. It can play both ways at once.For bringing simplification games to a new level of complexity, go to Picasso. Bather Opening a Cabin shows... could it be simpler? At the seaside, a naked woman climbs up two steps to open a beach hut with a key. (This key: a sign of Picasso's conspiratorial sex-life at the time.)The steps and hut are shown as shapes in profile, a unified area of grey. The sea behind is an area of blue. The sky above is an area of lighter blue. All these areas are straight edged and flat and simple. The bather is not.Compared to a teapot-figure or a demijohn-figure, Picasso's bather is relatively elaborate. Its body goes beyond a basic human scheme. It has a head and a full complement of limbs. It may be a radical distortion of a human likeness, at first sight suggesting some kind of bird. But it's not derived from a single, simple form.Still, it is put together with extreme economy, from just three very simple elements. These pieces can be given names. Coming from the right, the first one will be called the ""boomerang"", though it's a boomerang with arms of unequal lengths. The second will be called the ""tent-peg"", a straight upright that's hooked over at the top. The third will be called the ""folding ruler"", after one of those hinged measuring rods.These three pieces can be identified so clearly and distinctly because that's the way they are. It's what their edges tell us. They look as if originally they were separate bits, and now they're stuck together - the boomerang laid over the tent-peg, the folding ruler attached onto the tent-peg - but could come apart again.They look solid, too: flattish, yes, but hard, probably wooden, with a bit of volume. They are forms you could imagine carving or holding in the hand. In effect, this is a painting of a sculpture, of a work of assemblage. You could confidently reconstruct the whole thing yourself in 3D.But dwell on the three separate components, and you also start to notice Picasso's wit. These shapes suggest not just wood but driftwood - wooden items that were once hand-made or manufactured, but are now worn smooth by the sea. So this sculpture is made from found objects, and from things you could have been found on this very beach.They have another point in common. Though with very different shapes, each one has two prongs. Boomerang, tent-peg, folding ruler, they are all bent double, and approximately at a right angle. This fact is part of the sculpture's economy. And there's another neat fact about them. Their wood is a pale wood, and this introduces a material pun. Wood/flesh: the golden brown colour of a lightwood can equally be the colour of sun-tanned white skin.It's not the only pun around. When you see how this assemblage of three two-pronged pieces create a human figure, further ambiguities appear. Now it's true that some equations are firmly established. The upright of the boomerang stands for the back leg. The bottom half of the tent-peg represents the front leg. Its top half is the neck. The splayed folding ruler, weirdly but clearly, makes the two arms.At which point, play can begin. The same component part will suggest different parts of the body. For example, the bend of the boomerang is a buttock, or a hip, or a shoulder. All possible: and all possible together. The left tip of the boomerang is a protruding breast or the other shoulder. And between bend and tip there is a non-specific area of torso.The top of the tent-peg, projecting horizontally, is a horsey head jutting out from a neck, but also perhaps a nose jutting out from a face. It evokes the general, multiple sticking-out-ness - chin, nose, brow - of a head seen in profile.The folding ruler is certainly equated with the two arms, but what sort of action does it gives to them? Might it snap shut like a clapperboard? Is it a kind of twisting or winding instrument, to be rotated round on the tip of the boomerang - rotated like the key that one of its arms is in fact trying (somehow) to turn?This playfulness carries a truth. The body, as we experience it, isn't a fixed and labelled anatomical map. It's made up of gestures and shapings, of curves, juttings, extrusions, bends. But Picasso also fits out his figure with a series of more precise form-jokes, explicitly sexual. The head has three marks that stand for the two eyes and a mouth. The torso has three marks in the same formation that stand for the two breasts and a vagina.So vagina matches mouth - but also, the hairy vagina is marked by a stroke that reiterates the flicked strokes making up the brushy head-hair. And then, up between the two legs, rises a blue and light-blue shape, looking like a lighthouse (another typical seaside feature) or a circumcised penis.Representational games abound. They link up and mix up the parts of this body, and generally mess around with it. But what they don't do is reduce them to flux. All the echoes and ambiguities arise out of forms that are themselves stably defined.There are Picasso paintings from this time where bodies are made in flowing and unbounded lines, dreamy figures whose every form dissolves into others. They perform the same games, but they exist only on the canvas surface. It would be impossible to imagine them made in 3D. The have no suggestions of solidity.In Bather Opening a Cabin the solidity is crucial. The figure is made from hard pieces stuck together, and what it's made of determines its character. Each piece is bent but rigid. The whole body is inarticulate. You can't imagine it flexing or moving or climbing.Its uneven legs are fixed. It's propped on the steps like a helpless ornament on a shelf. And almost every part of this female body is as stiff and rounded and helpless as a swelling penis. It's a comic creation, which belongs with a vulgar beach postcard.About the artistPablo Picasso (1881-1973) needs no introduction. The Spanish painter became in his lifetime the most famous artist in the world, with a fame up there with Chaplin and Disney and Einstein and Hitler. It wasn't just a matter of talents. He lived in the 20th century, the first century of global mass publicity. But he had everything. He was a child prodigy. He worked in every medium. He invented or inspired most modern art styles - Cubism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism. He had genius eyes, unflagging testosterone and political engagement ('Guernica'). His work was never really popular, not like Van Gogh's or Dali's. In recent decades his art influence has run out, replaced by Marcel Duchamp's. What was he: the great revitaliser, or the great swan-song, of the Western pictorial tradition?Word count: 1353Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

As they have proved in spectacular fashion before, when Gagosian teams with Mr. Richardson, Picasso's foremost biographer, they can elicit quality loans. This joint venture is no different. The wall of drawings from 1908-10, on the left as you walk in, is mostly borrowed from private collections. Picasso's cubist studies--in which he methodically breaks down the continuous human figure, including the eyes and ears, and forges the parts into stronger, baser elements--are often more enjoyable to behold than the finished result. Cubism was a way to replicate and remake the appearance of all things, as was photography. Mr. Richardson proposes that the automatic abstracting found in black-and-white printing aided in Picasso's and Braque's visual revolution. To back up the argument, the catalog reproduces a 1982 article from the Art Bulletin by Paul Hayes Tucker, then professor of art history at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, in which he suggests that a 1909 group of photographs taken by Picasso in Spain may stand behind the cubist landscapes he painted that summer in Horta de Ebro. Two paintings cited by Mr. Tucker--one from the Museum of Modern Art, one from the Denver Art Museum--hang here next to two of those photographs. Viewers can decide whether the rooftops going every which way and the canted perspective in the monochrome prints shaped the tightly interlocking planes in the brown-green-gray painting ""Le R√©servoir."" Mr. Tucker was careful not to overstate the impact of Picasso's photography on the work, concluding that ""all of this, of course, remains somewhat speculative; there were many other influences that Picasso synthesized that summer."" A vitrine nearby features his snapshots of his paintings from this period. The fact that as a young artist he wanted to document his work in photographs is more telling than the photographs themselves, which are small and in many cases faded. Picasso developed a mania to date everything he did, and the camera aided in the chronicling of his legend. As he told the photographer Brass√§i in the 1960s--in words that sanctioned the attention of biographers like Mr. Richardson--""it's not enough to know an artist's works. One must also know when he made them, why, how, under what circumstances."" In the photographs Picasso took and the even greater number taken of him, the show also traces his active social life, as well as his marital, and extramarital, relationships. There are smiling portraits of his first wife, the ballerina Olga Khokhlova, from 1917, as well as less happy ones done a few years later. Sergei Diaghilev, L√©onide Massine, Natalia Goncharova and Jean Cocteau have cameo roles in snapshots of larky excursions in Paris, Rome, Barcelona and Monte Carlo. Playing on four monitors in the center of the room are loops of home movies from the 1930s (one taken by Man Ray) that capture Picasso with friends on vacation in the south of France. Other shorter clips show him as doting father, with his son Paul, and as owner of a Great Pyr√©n√©es, a dog almost bigger than he is. The series of photographs Picasso made in 1931 at the Ch√¢teau de Boisgeloup (on the back wall at Gagosian) had a more serious purpose: He wanted to catalog the constant alterations he was making to the clay sculptures based on his mistress Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter. For the first time, he seems careful about lighting and angles. In a photograph of Olga posed outside his studio, where the bust of Walter is visible behind her, he may even be leaving clues for posterity--and making a cruel joke--about where his true feelings lay. (When Brass√§i's photographs of these phallic sculptures were published in the surrealist magazine Minotaure, in 1933, they created a sensation.) Picasso also at times relied on photographic images as source material for paintings. Jean Painlev√©'s underwater film documentaries from the late 1920s were beloved by the surrealists, and Mr. Richardson suggests a connection between one of them, about an octopus, and ""Femme nue couch√©e,"" a 1932 portrait of Walter with arms like tentacles. The 357 photographic reproductions of archaic Greek sculpture in Christian Zervos's 1934 book ""L'art en Gr√®ce"" likely inspired Picasso's sculptures and drawings around the same time. But beyond these examples, there isn't much here to back up the statement in the press release that Picasso used photography as ""an integral part of his studio practice."" He didn't pick up a camera to explore its unique potential for picture-making, as did, say, Degas and Brancusi. Nor was he curious how it might serve to open a door to the uncanny, an obsession of his lover Dora Maar and of Man Ray. The largest part of the show, fascinating in its own right, documents how Picasso exploited photographers--and they him--in creating the myth of the protean genius with the bald head and burning gaze. A celebrity before he was 30, he sustained that status to the end of his life and beyond, thanks in no small part to photography and film. Picasso had his portrait taken more often than any other 20th-century artist (except probably Andy Warhol) and many of those who helped to burnish his image--Brass√§i, Lucien Clergue, Arnold Newman, Edward Quinn, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, Man Ray, Andr√© Villers--are included here. Filmmakers played their part, too. In 1949, two years before Jackson Pollock did a painting on a sheet of glass for Hans Namuth's camera, Picasso drew with a light stick for Gjon Mili and Life magazine. Bare-chested, wielding his pen like a sword, the middle-aged artist is like an athlete who doesn't imagine that he might ever make a mistake. One feels the swaggering self-confidence that intoxicated so many who entered his circle. Dora Maar's photographs of him from the mid-'30s (some only in the catalog) reveal a more inward-looking man and are more sensitive than any Picasso took of others. Perhaps because during their intense love affair she was using photography to explore surrealist effects, he didn't see a need to compete with her. Or perhaps he didn't think that a mechanical device could do much for his hand-generated art. Mr. Richardson says that the idea for ""Picasso and the Camera"" began with a work (found on the gallery's right wall) that he owns and that adorned the cover of the third volume of his biography. It is a pencil portrait of Picasso done in 1921 by his lover Valentine Hugo. When she photographed it in 1937 and presented it to him, he drew motifs from ""Guernica"" around his chin, like a beard. Such treatment does not indicate a high regard for photographs as objects. They were just another material to rework with his pen, much the same way that he cut up Andr√© Villers's prints with his scissors for their 1962 collaborative series, ""Diurnes."" It is hard not to conclude from this generous display that Picasso used the camera mainly to document his progress as a towering artist, and that the images he made with this slavish tool are more precious to art historians and biographers than they ever were to him.

Even among Picasso scholars, few have seen the ""Painter and Model"" he made in 1927 or even a color reproduction of it. I have devoted 30 years to studying Pablo Picasso's art, yet I never expected to encounter its actual 46 square feet of canvas. Now, I am one of the lucky ones who has and can celebrate both the picture and the rare but growing opportunities to view it in public exhibitions. If we drew an arc across the great years of Picasso's career during the first half of the 20th century, there would be two paramount achievements: ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"" in 1907 and ""Guernica"" in 1937. The first was Picasso's breakthrough as he shattered the artistic conventions of the 19th century; the second became the most powerful work capturing the humanitarian crises and political violence of the 20th century. Within the 30-year period separating these two masterpieces lies another: ""Painter and Model."" In my view, ""Painter and Model"" is not only Picasso's most important painting since ""Les Demoiselles"" but also the essential precedent for ""Guernica."" It is the missing link in the career of the greatest artist of the 20th century. We know Picasso began ""Painter and Model"" with high ambitions because he selected one of the largest canvases he had used since ""Les Demoiselles,"" and he chose the exceptional proportions of that earlier painting -- a nearly square format that concentrates the composition and isolates it from the surrounding panorama of everyday things. But the strategy he employed to capture the imagination of the viewer of ""Painter and Model"" is radically different from the aggressive confrontation between prostitutes and audience in ""Les Demoiselles."" ""Painter and Model"" delivers not the explicit shock of naked bodies, but the opposite -- blindness, disorientation and hallucination. This monumental canvas is filled with darkness. Deep gray shadows cover much of the surface and make it so difficult to discover what lies within the space of the painting that specialists have puzzled over mediocre reproductions for years. Even in person, the composition is at first a confusing pattern of darkness punctuated by patches of light, both dazzlingly white and mellow. As we adjust to these jolting contrasts, the situation begins to resolve into a reality both familiar and disturbing. Along the lower edge of the painting, floorboards emerge, marking the space of an interior. Near the center of this room stands a woman who might have stepped from ""Les Demoiselles."" Flattened to a grotesque outline of distended eyes, nose, breasts and limbs, this life-size figure is an even more hideous distortion of the human body than any in the Demoiselles, yet she is severed from that painting's sexual confrontation of prostitutes and client. She seems to stand alone in the murky, light-struck room, an emblem of the darkest experience. Only long and careful examination reveals that she is not alone or necessarily the main character of the composition. Unlike the stark spotlight falling on the woman, a gentle, yellowish glow illuminates a crescent of space on the right side of the painting. In it resides the artist. Equally distorted, he consists only of thick rectilinear lines (unlike the curvilinear ones defining the woman) so spare and scattered that we might easily miss the figure they describe. As the golden light reveals, the artist holds his palette (a flattened ""U"" rotated 90 degrees and enclosing a large circle) at the end of a zig-zag arm. Crossed by both light and dark near the top right corner of the canvas, the artist's head is his most important and strangest feature. It is like a weapon -- flattened into a saw-toothed, pointed blade on which two eyes are vertically aligned. An arm extends from this gaping mouth to paint with a brush on a blank canvas next to the head of the woman, his model. Of Picasso's hundreds of images of the artist at work, this is the most horrific. Instead of it being a passive site in which the artist works quietly before a posing model, Picasso conceived the studio as a place of intellectual conflict in which artist and model engage in a creative exchange, albeit orchestrated by the artist. ""Painter and Model"" shows the culmination of this struggle, one that has unlocked the most disturbing depths of the human imagination, all set in the blandest of everyday places. Picasso described ""Les Demoiselles"" as ""an exorcism"" of evil forces from the artist or viewer. In ""Painter and Model,"" artist and audience are not separate from the danger. They penetrate the painting's hallucinatory darkness and share in the violence that transforms the model. This willingness not only to acknowledge inhumanity but to plumb its depths was one of Picasso's greatest but least-praised achievements, far less admired than its complement -- his celebration of sensual pleasure. When he reached back to ""Les Demoiselles"" to create ""Painter and Model,"" Picasso gathered the tools he would need for ""Guernica,"" whose shadowy space and writhing women bring to the public stage the private horror of the figures in ""Painter and Model."" Except for the chances of the marketplace, this painting would be in the Museum of Modern Art with ""Les Demoiselles."" William Rubin, who led the museum's painting department from the early 1970s through the early '90s, told me that of all the Picasso paintings he sought for the museum, ""this was the one that got away."" When Mr. Rubin tried to acquire it from the Swiss dealer Ernst Beyeler in the '70s, another client with deeper pockets and an ambition to establish a great collection of modern Western art bought it first -- the shah of Iran. ""Painter and Model"" entered the state collection two years before the opening of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in 1977 and four years before the overthrow of the shah. By all accounts, it has since been well protected in the basement of the museum. In 2003-04, ""Painter and Model"" appeared in an exhibition in Rome. In late 2010 through early 2011, it was shown at the Kunsthaus in Zurich, where I finally saw it. This last appearance has sparked discussions that may result in an exhibition that will provide the opportunity for many people to see not only this seminal Picasso but also other works in the Tehran museum's remarkable collection of modern Western art, including major paintings by Johns, Monet, van Gogh and Warhol. --- Mr. FitzGerald teaches the history of modern art at Trinity College.

No single literal reading can be drawn from the distortions of the figure and the confluences of facial features and multiple profiles. Still, it has been suggested that Picasso combines three heads into one: the head in profile at left is that of the artist; the head in profile at right is that of his son Paulo; and the one at centre locking the other two heads is that of Picasso‚Äôs first wife, Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova.In 1964, the Art Gallery of Ontario purchased Seated Woman from New York‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art, and it quickly took its place as the most celebrated painting by Picasso in Canada.Discover Seated Woman in Picasso in Canada, one of two exhibitions exploring the many sides of Pablo Picasso.

Picasso was viewed through drastically different ideological lenses in former East and West Germany.Picasso (1881-1973) is a popular artist even today, 48 years after his death. Just this May, one of his works, Woman Sitting Near a Window, was auctioned for $103.4 million (‚Ç¨88.2 million).In 2015, the artist's most expensive painting until then, The Women of Algiers, changed hands for $179.4 million (‚Ç¨153 million).Beyond the fact that Picasso's works are still in demand, seemingly everything has been said and written about the influential 20th-century artist and sculptor, whose full name was: Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santisima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso.Yet curators still find new angles to approach his works.An exhibition in Cologne's Museum Ludwig under the title, Picasso Shared and Divided: The Artist and His Image in East and West Germany, looks into the two countries' astonishingly varied reception of the artist.Different viewsThe iron curtain, which divided the world for more than four decades into irreconcilable political blocs - socialism and capitalism - certainly played a strong role in how Picasso was perceived in the East and the West.In 1944, Picasso joined the Communist Party of France. He called it ""a logical step in my life, in my work."" He participated in campaigns, traveled to peace conferences, for which he also created posters.He created political works like The Charnel House, which depicted horrors of the Nazi regime, or Massacre in Korea, about American war crimes. One his most famous paintings is also as an anti-war work: Guernica, named after the Basque city that was bombed by German planes. His series of murals War and Peace were conceived for a chapel in the Communist-governed village of Vallauris, in southern France, aiming to create a ""Temple of Peace.""Picasso also took on commissions like painting Josef Stalin on his birthday or making a sketch of the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.Stalin and peace?But could a portrait of Stalin be reconciled with a Temple of Peace?""In the post-war world, yes,"" says Cologne curator Julia Friedrich, ""in any case for Picasso and other communists.""Many artists identified themselves during that period with the socialist movement for peace, for which Picasso created the ultimate motive: the dove.Picasso's friend, the poet Louis Aragon, had chosen his Dove lithograph to illustrate the poster of the 1949 Paris Peace Congress.The painter, who even as a child made sketches of his father's doves, kept creating variations of the bird afterwards.His doves were especially popular in the socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR). For instance, Picasso's drawings were featured on posters of peace movements and in school books.As curator Friedrich speculates, they were ""certainly more popular and perhaps even more widely circulated than the official national emblem of East Germany, the hammer and the compass surrounded by a wreath of rye.""Even though the artist was considered a model communist activist, there were hardly any Picasso exhibitions in the GDR's early years. His anti-realist style was rejected by East German authorities, as the masses were supposed to recognize themselves in art.The political artist - concealedThe approach was completely different in the West.Picasso was greatly respected in West Germany as well, but here he was promoted as a pillar of contemporary art. All kinds of exhibitions presented him as a reviver of art, and worshiped him as a charismatic genius.In 1955, his Guernica was shown at the Munich art museum Haus der Kunst, but the Foreign Office in Berlin warned the curators against the ""political leanings"" of the work.The political Picasso, says Cologne curator Friedrich, was largely concealed in the West.Picasso Shared and Divided is on show at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne until January 30, 2022.This article was translated from German.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.Word count: 638Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

It is these key components that embrace the works in TRUTH + INTERPRETATION by Dave Maddocks at the Wayne Arthur Gallery. This was my first time in the Wayne Arthur Gallery and it is immediately evident that this is a lovingly family-run gallery. The space projects a comfortable and inviting aura through its array of approachable commercial art. Everything from ceramic works to prints to jewelry is available at the gallery; while the works are not cutting-edge by any means, they are nevertheless attractive and very accessible.In his artist's statement, Maddocks says: ""I learned to apply colour and composition theory as a graphic designer and I wanted to use that knowledge to present a subject to the viewer in the most honest and direct manner possible.""His structured perspective makes a difference in the way the work in his small collection at the Wayne Arthur Gallery can be understood. The world of graphic design is broken down into distinct visual components such as hue, line and form in order to create a universally understood visual. Maddocks takes this approach and brings it to the canvas, creating clean and interesting paintings and drawings.He has chosen to display three very distinct yet classic styles of work and subjects: still lifes, landscapes and nudes. He has broken down everyday scenes and the human form into sections of light, colour and shape, bringing his own truth and interpretation to these subjects. Maddocks' landscapes start off the show, and they show his aptitude for painting the outdoors with care and precision. He applies his paint in an Impressionistic manner to depict scenes of the Canadian wilderness, giving them an emotional and static quality. In works such as Weather Lake, Maddocks captures the feeling of an overcast sky by breaking down the clouds into puffs of glossy white form. The series of nudes are by far the best works in the show. Maddocks captures the female body in a way that is reminiscent of artists like Pablo Picasso or Amedeo Modigliani. The various poses give him the opportunity to play with proportion and line, allowing the nudes to become more than just drawings of naked women; they are also interesting explorations of body, line and light.Maddocks brings sculptural qualities to the nudes through the application of his chosen media of cont√© and chalk. His chunky shading allows thick and varying blocks of shadow to take the form into a three-dimensional light.The works that go into the more distorted and jarring territory seem to be the most interesting. This is where Maddocks goes into the aforementioned styles that are indicative of master artists. He has taken the various degrees and perspectives of the nude form and squeezed, stretched and abstracted them. He has not gone so far as to completely distort the figure into a jumble of line and shape, but has taken the contour of the subject and turned it into an interpretation of awkward and striking beauty through his style. TRUTH + INTERPRETATION gives viewers an accessible look at traditional subjects and media in an appealing light. Maddocks' graphic take on his subject areas makes for a selection of works that anyone can enjoy. freep.artreview@gmail.com Wayne Arthur Gallery 186 Provencher Blvd.Word count: 582Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But he continued to paint and was planning to show more than 200 pieces of his work the following month.He had marked his 90th birthday the previous year with a retrospective exhibition held at the Louvre in Paris. It was the first time the work of a living artist had been exhibited.Born in 1881 in Spain, Picasso had exhibited his first painting in Barcelona aged 12. It was estimated he had produced a further 20,000 paintings, sculptures and drawings.Guernica, inspired by an outrage during the Spanish Civic War, was highly regarded as his best work.A lifelong Communist, Picasso never returned to his homeland after Franco's victory.Picasso was buried in the grounds of his French chateau and he bequeathed his art collection including works by Cezanne, Braque and Matisse, to the Louvre.In 1981 his famous painting Guernica was sent to Spain from New York and now takes pride of place in a museum in Madrid.Word count: 212Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Picasso.Mania, which opened on Wednesday, has brought together work by some of the most renowned contemporary artists and filmmakers, from David Hockney and Jasper Johns to Roy Lichtenstein, Jeff Koons and Jean-Luc Godard, to trace how the impact of Picasso's work goes far beyond the realm of visual art -- and can still be felt to this day. The blockbuster autumn exhibition, which features 78 artists, is centred around three pivotal moments in the Spanish artists's life: cubism; his works from the late 1930s when he first created his archetypal image of the turned face; and his late works, which were exhibited in the 1970s in Avignon. It also focuses on the lasting cultural legacy of Picasso's most emblematic works: Guernica and Les Demoiselles D'Avignon. Didier Ottinger, who curated the exhibition, admitted it was one of the most ambitious shows staged at the Grand Palais and had taken three years to pull off. He said: ""The purpose was to study the legacy of Picasso, not just through visual art but also through cinema, through music and even advertising, which is something huge because Picasso seems to be everywhere. We wanted to emphasise this very specific dimension of Picasso, which is that he is not only a painter but a man responsible for incarnating the genius of the 20th and now 21st century."" Unlike the 20 or so visual art exhibitions that have been staged since 1973 exploring the influence on Picasso on contemporary art, Picasso.Mania has a strong multimedia focus, including Hockney's 2012 video piece The Jugglers, a 2009 video installation by Rineke Dijkstra and clips from Godard's film Breathless. A brand new photo and digital work by Hockney, titled A Bigger Card Players, is also on display. Elements of the exhibition explore legacies such as the enduring image of Picasso's own face in art, including Maurizio Cattelan's kitsch larger-than-life fibreglass sculpture of Picasso, as well as the continued political significance of Guernica, symbolised by its transposition onto a tapestry now on the walls of the UN security council building. The premise of the show was risky, said Ottinger, because there was a chance artists would not want their work directly compared with Picasso. However, as George Condo, the American painter who has 17 works adorning the final wall of the exhibition, said, it was ""great to be recognised on such a level and hung next to an artist who you love"". Condo's recognisable paintings, which feature figures with grotesque expressions and cartoonish, exaggerated features, are often directly compared to Picasso's later figurative work. The works Condo chose to put in the show all feature naked figures with voluptuous flesh and all seemingly engaged in erotic and carnal activities, including two previously unseen paintings done just for the show. ""I wanted to draw all the unabashed, hysterical eroticism that we could possibly get out of my paintings,"" said Condo. ""I think Picasso in the last few years of his life became obsessive about it all, so I wanted to curate a body of my own work that would relate to that, which was both erotic but also insane, and really exhibit this mania. Those paintings are projections of a life I would never dare to live in my own true self."" Condo recalled his first encounter with Picasso in 1969, age 13, when he saw a picture of one of his paintings in the newspaper. The only art he was familiar with up to that point was religious images in churches and he was so intrigued he went out and bought a book on Picasso, which was his first introduction to modern art. Picasso's willingness to shock and ""cannibalise"" the Old Masters has also been an influence on Condo, who, thanks both to his grotesque portrait of the Queen and his provocative cover for Kanye West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, is no stranger to controversy. ""If I don't shock myself I consider it to be not a very good painting,"" he said. ""When Picasso did Les Demoisselles d'Avignon people thought it was a disgrace, and it was the same with the album cover I did for Kanye. It depicted an interracial couple naked, and there was this political backlash."" However, Condo said he hoped the show would also make people realise that while Picasso was an inspiration in his painting, his work was not simply a copy or bastardisation of the artist. ""Whereas something like the Roy Lichtenstein is a real knock-off of Picasso, there's actually no pure reference to Picasso in any of my works,"" he said. ""I thought that this show would clarify the differences between his work and mine, more than the similarities. That would be the ironic result of it all -- that finally people will stop saying 'oh it looks so much like Picasso'.""

Drake confirmed that he did indeed father a son named Adonis with the release of his album ""Scorpion"" in June 2018.

Marina's brother committed suicide in 1973, after reportedly not being allowed by Picasso's second wife, Jacqueline, to see Picasso on his deathbed.""He drove everyone who got near him to despair and engulfed them,"" Marina wrote of her grandfather, in a 2001 memoir. She has said her inheritance was ""given without love.""I can come up with about 290 million reasons why I don't feel too sorry for her.A friend of Marina reportedly told the Post her decision to sell ""is about letting go of the past.""Uh-huh.Tony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.

Picasso was viewed through drastically different ideological lenses in former East and West Germany.Picasso (1881-1973) is a popular artist even today, 48 years after his death. Just this May, one of his works, Woman Sitting Near a Window, was auctioned for $103.4 million (88.2 million).In 2015, the artist's most expensive painting until then, The Women of Algiers, changed hands for $179.4 million (153 million).Beyond the fact that Picasso's works are still in demand, seemingly everything has been said and written about the influential 20th-century artist and sculptor, whose full name was Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios Cipriano de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso.Yet curators still find new angles to approach his works. An exhibition in Cologne's Museum Ludwig entitled Picasso Shared and Divided: The Artist and His Image in East and West Germany, looks into the two countries' very different interpretations of the artist.Different viewsThe iron curtain, which divided the world for more than four decades into irreconcilable political blocs - socialism and capitalism - certainly played a strong role in how Picasso was perceived in the East and the West.In 1944, Picasso joined the Communist Party of France. He called it ""a logical step in my life, in my work."" He participated in campaigns and traveled to peace conferences, for which he also created posters.He created political works like The Charnel House, which depicted horrors of the Nazi regime, or Massacre in Korea, about American war crimes. One his most famous paintings is also as an anti-war work: Guernica, named after the Basque city that was bombed by German planes. His series of murals War and Peace were conceived for a chapel in the Communist-governed village of Vallauris, in southern France, aiming to create a ""Temple of Peace.""Picasso also took on commissions like painting Josef Stalin on his birthday or making a sketch of the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.Stalin and peace?But could a portrait of Stalin be reconciled with a Temple of Peace?""In the post-war world, yes,"" says Cologne curator Julia Friedrich, ""in any case for Picasso and other communists.""Many artists identified themselves during that period with the socialist movement for peace, for which Picasso created the ultimate motif: the dove.Picasso's friend, the poet Louis Aragon, had chosen his Dove lithograph to illustrate the poster of the 1949 Paris Peace Congress. The painter, who even as a child made sketches of his father's doves, kept creating variations of the bird afterwards.His doves were especially popular in the socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR). For instance, Picasso's drawings were featured on posters of peace movements and in school books.As curator Friedrich speculates, they were ""certainly more popular and perhaps even more widely circulated than the official national emblem of East Germany, the hammer and the compass surrounded by a wreath of rye.""Even though the artist was considered a model communist activist, there were hardly any Picasso exhibitions in the GDR's early years. His anti-realist style was rejected by East German authorities, as the masses were supposed to recognize themselves in art.The political artist - concealedThe approach was completely different in the West.Picasso was greatly respected in West Germany as well, but here he was promoted as a pillar of contemporary art. All kinds of exhibitions presented him as a reviver of art, and worshiped him as a charismatic genius.In 1955, his Guernica was shown at the Munich art museum Haus der Kunst, but the Foreign Ministry in Berlin warned the curators against the ""political leanings"" of the work.The political Picasso, says Cologne curator Friedrich, was largely concealed in the West.Picasso Shared and Divided is on show at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne until January 30, 2022.Source: DW - Deutsche Welle Word count: 624Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

This superb ensemble (enriched with a handful of ceramics), to be exhibited from 28th March-1st April during the Salon International du Dessin in Paris, will focus the theme of The Nude in Picasso's work. Starting with his erotically tinged Indian ink sketches of prostitutes from his Barcelona period, and continuing down to his remarkable Artist & Model series, the Nude remained a subject of constant desire and fascination for Picasso, one which he explored in a variety of styles and media. It was the theme of the Nude which, in 1906/07, prompted Picasso to engage in the visual experimentation that would ultimately lead to Cubism. This can be seen in the numerous preparatory studies for his legendary work Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Several of these are featured in the exhibition, among them Woman's Body - Front View (1908), where Picasso uses hatching to create the outlines of a faceless female body reduced to an angular, sculptural structure. The process of deconstruction is clear to see. Later drawings include an enchanting 1920 charcoal and red chalk Standing Nude in Profile. The Nude here is idealized and stylized: a perfect illustration of Picasso's return to Classicism in the 1920s, in line with the teachings of Ancient Greece, and revealing another facet of his oeuvre.Word count: 233Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

In real life, it's a huge painting - about 18m long by 3.5m high - and at that scale the effect is overpowering. I was struck by the enormity of it and thought it was a masterpiece.The painting is a brilliant depiction of the bombing of the town of Guernica on April 26 1937 by German bombers called in by Franco. It took three and a half hours to annihilate the town. Around 1,600 people were killed and many more were wounded.Originally, Picasso was commissioned by the Spanish Republican government to represent Spain in the Paris Exposition of 1937. He wasn't usually a very political painter, but on this occasion he was so outraged by the event that he threw himself into it. The result is a brilliantly thought-out painting.To me, the image is a symbol of human barbarity and of resistance to oppression. In the middle of the picture, there's a hand holding a light, like a ray of hope. The horse - also in the middle - represents the people. On the left you have a bull, which represents barbarity. There's also a mother holding a baby who is obviously dead. Her face is screaming up to heaven. I find it a very moving scene.There's a basic mystery to this painting and, even now, every time I look at it I see something different. I think it relates universally to an ocean of pain and death. It could represent the second world war, Vietnam or all the other wars we've had. The more I look, the more I see - and the more I feel total empathy, without having ever been there.

The dramatic fluctuations in Picasso's style during the period surrounding World War I, from 1912 to 1924, are highlighted in ""Picasso: The Great War, Experimentation and Change.""The show at the Barnes Foundation on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway brings together some 50 works by the artist from major American and European museums and private collections, including paintings, drawings, watercolors and costumes designed for the avant-garde ballet, Parade, as well as several pieces by his friends and contemporaries. Picasso began experimenting with naturalistic representation, turning out classical figure drawings that outraged many of his avant-garde colleagues - this was quite a shift from the radical cubist approach he had been developing since 1907.""A radical shift occurred in Picasso's work in 1914,"" explained exhibition curator Simonetta Fraquelli. ""Following seven years of refining the visual language of cubism, he began to introduce elements of naturalism to his work.""Picasso did not give up cubism, however. Instead, he shuttled back and forth between two different styles for over a decade, breaking forms apart and making them whole again. Fraquelli, an independent curator and specialist in early 20th-century European art, adds, ""What becomes evident when looking at Picasso's work during this period is that his two artistic styles - cubism and neoclassicism - are not antithetical; on the contrary, each informs the other, to the degree that the metamorphosis from one style to the other is so natural for the artist that occasionally they occur in the same works of art.""The exhibition looks closely at Picasso's wartime production, exploring it in connection with changes to his personal life, with his misgivings about cubism, and with the political meanings ascribed to cubism during the war. The exhibition will travel to the Columbus Museum of Art in June.The Barnes Foundation, in partnership with the Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio, premieres ""Picasso: The Great War, Experimentation and Change,"" on Sunday. On view through May 9, the exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalog, published by Scala Arts. The Barnes is located at 2025 Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

The exhibition will be shown at the museum through Sept. 11 and covers a period from before the war started in 1912 to after the war in 1924.""The fact that Picasso is going back and forth from cubism to more figurative drawing ... this restless creativity that constantly explores, constantly looks, constantly experiments -- that is the heart of the show,"" said Nannette Maciejunes, executive director of the museum on Broad Street in Ohio's capital. ""This [period] is the first time he does it, but he does it throughout his career. From now on he will never again do one style of painting.""The exhibition is a collaboration with the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia and was curated by the CMA's chief curator, David Stark; Martha Lucy, consulting curator at Barnes, and guest curator Simonetta Fraquelli of Milan, Italy, a specialist in early 20th-century European art.The Columbus exhibit was inspired by a masterwork owned by the museum: Still Life with Compote and Glass, created by Picasso in 1914-15. The museum wanted to do more than a still life show depicting Picasso's career, and Stark said it seemed fitting to choose the period around the first world war, which is in the midst of its 100th anniversary. Picasso and French artist Georges Braque had already developed the cubist movement in Paris, and by the end of the exhibition's period, Europe was being introduced to the surrealist movement, Stark said.""This is a good place in terms of Picasso's style,"" Stark said. ""He had already been working in Cubism for about five years, and by the time you hit 1912, in the so called late cubist style, he was being playful, experimenting with different techniques and introducing different kinds of shapes and innovative materials into his paintings.""Pieces in the show were loaned by major European collections, including from three Picasso museums in Europe, the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, and the Musee National Picasso in Paris; American collections; and private collections, with major support from private collector Ferdinand Howald, who loaned much of his collection of American and European art to CMA and other museums.The show is a story that navigates visitors through different artistic and personal moments in Picasso's life. In addition to paintings that depict the fragmented technique the artist is known for, visitors will see in his drawings and paintings both major and slight transformations from a strict cubist style to classical and traditional realist form.""It isn't just this simple juxtaposition between cubism and realism. There are all these iterations, there are these distortions and there is something highly realistic ... he's just moving on that continuum,"" said Maciejunes.The side-by-side paintings, Pierrot, which was loaned to the show by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and Harlequin with Violin, loaned by the Cleveland Museum of Art, are good examples of Picasso's vibrations between drastically different styles. Both done in 1918, they depict the same figure in different moods, but while the melancholy Pierrot clown figure is painted in a more realistic style, Picasso paints Harlequin in clear cubist style.Pencil drawings of friend Max Jacob and wife Olga Picasso, done in 1917 and 1918 respectively, are extremely realistic in nature, while the 1915 drawing, Reclining Woman, is highly fragmented.A 1920 oil on canvas called Studiesshows an array of techniques by Picasso, his different artistic forms compartmentalized almost like a modern-day photo collage.""A lot of people don't understand that Picasso was able to paint like a very skilled traditional painter when he was a teenager and that the decision to adopt and embrace an abstract style was conscious and the decision of an artist in full command of all the traditional painting techniques,"" Stark said. ""He was drawing on skills he had within him, and was using them at the time in his career and the time in history when the time seemed right to express himself in this more traditional mode.""Picasso worked in other media, and visitors will get to see at this exhibition costumes the artist created for the 1917 avant-garde ballet, Parade, and rare, delicate drawings and portraits in charcoal and pencil.Accompanying the show is the exhibit, Pablo Picasso: 25 years of Edition Ceramics, an installation of 40 ceramic pieces created by Picasso with other French potters between 1947 and 1971.Included in the gallery is a fascinating array of photographs taken by Jean Cocteau, the writer of the Parade ballet, of Picasso, Olga, and others having a fun day at different Paris locales on Aug. 12, 1916. The photos, which were unearthed in the 1970s, were taken the day Cocteau convinced Picasso to design the costumes for his ballet.Another room of the exhibit displays the works of artists that influenced Picasso in some way, both negatively and positively, including Braque, Henri Matisse, and Diego Rivera. Picasso considered Matisse an equal in artistic talent, and so there was much competition there, while Picasso saw Rivera as less talented, and so their rivalry was less so, Stark and Maciejunes said.Many of the works in the exhibition, such as The Guitar, a piece painted by Braque in 1917 and 1918 -just a few years after he was wounded in action in the war and had brain surgery -depict artist struggles within wartime.Unlike Vincent Van Gogh, who thoroughly chronicled thoughts and concepts behind his work, Picasso was oftentimes cloaked in mystery. Art historian theories behind Picasso's variation in technique are many, including that Picasso was responding to a movement during the war to condemn Cubism as a German movement that was a threat to French cultureAlthough Picasso, who was of Spanish descent, couldn't have bought into that theory since he, himself, developed Cubism along with Braque, he might have been aligning himself with a more acceptable means of expression, Stark said.A lesser theory was that Picasso's wife, Olga, wanted the couple to align themselves with Paris' upper class, and to that end, thought he would be more comfortable in social circles if his art reflected a more traditional style, Stark said.But the theory that sticks most with art historians was Picasso's resistance to status quo, the idea that the master artist would not - and could not -stay within artistic restraints.""Sometimes the most radical thing an artist can do is to go backwards, or in this case taking what seems to be a more traditional route is almost the shocking and radical thing he could do. So not only does he start producing these exquisitely realistic and traditional looking works that could have been produced by, say, a 19th century French artist, he continues Cubism at the same time, and that is what is even more revolutionary,"" Stark said.""When an artist changes his style, very often or maybe more often than not, he leaves the old style behind but Picasso continued both simultaneously.""Picasso lived to be 91, dying in 1973.For more information on Picasso: The Great War, Experimentation and Change, go to columbusmuseum.org.Contact Roberta Gedert at: rgedert@theblade.com, 419-724-6075, or on Twitter @RoGedert.Credit: ROBERTA GEDERT/BLADE STAFF WRITERIllustrationCaption: A 1918 pencil-drawn self-portrait by Picasso.

The granddaughter of Pablo Picasso has discovered an extraordinary collection of sketchbooks used by the artists to teach his eldest daughter to draw and colour.Picasso filled the pages with playful scenes ‚Äì animals, birds, clowns, acrobats, horses and doves ‚Äì which would delight any child, as well as adults.He created them for Maya Ruiz-Picasso when she was aged between five and seven. On some pages, the little girl made impressive attempts to imitate the master. She also graded her father‚Äôs work, scribbling the number ‚Äú10‚Äù on a circus scene, to show her approval.He drew two charming images of a fox longing for grapes ‚Äì inspired by the 17th-century fabulist Jean de La Fontaine‚Äôs sour grapes fable, The Fox and the Grapes ‚Äì and Maya coloured in one of them. He also drew simple but beautiful eagles in a single movement, without raising the pencil from the paper, conveying his love of form and pure line to her.The previously unseen collection includes exquisite origami sculptures of birds that he brought to life for Maya from exhibition invitation cards.His granddaughter, Diana Widmaier-Ruiz-Picasso, found the works by chance while looking through family material in storage. Intrigued, she showed them to her mother, now 86, for whom memories came flooding back.Widmaier-Ruiz-Picasso told the Observer : ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòOf course, those are my sketchbooks when I was little‚Äô. We tend to be very visual in the family so immediately she was plunged into that time. It was a very moving moment, not only because you‚Äôre talking about one of the greatest artists but also because it made it very human. I was excited. Then I was moved.‚ÄùPicasso, who died in 1973, had been taught to draw by his father, a professor of drawing, ‚Äúso that was something natural for him to do‚Äù with Maya, his granddaughter said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a beautiful page where he‚Äôs drawing a bowl and she‚Äôs drawing a bowl.‚ÄúSometimes she‚Äôs making an image and he‚Äôs doing another, showing her the right way to do it. Sometimes they would depict different scenes. Other times, he would draw a dog or a hat. Sometimes he‚Äôs using the whole page to draw one particular thing. Other times, he‚Äôs depicting certain scenes, scenes of the circus. It‚Äôs very interesting.‚ÄùMaya particularly remembers that, during the second world war, colour pencils and notebooks were in short supply: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably why my father wrote in my exercise books and coloured with my pencils. I still have fond memories of those moments when we met up in the kitchen to draw together. It was the only place in the apartment where it was warm.‚ÄùWidmaier-Ruiz-Picasso is an art historian, curator and jewellery designer, who has just published her latest book, Picasso Sorcier, exploring his superstitions and belief in magic.She described the discovery of the sketchbooks as ‚Äúfortuitous‚Äù because she was co-curating a major exhibition for the Mus√©e Picasso-Paris on his close bond with his first daughter, born of his passionate love for Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, whom he met in 1927 when she was just 17 and he was 28 years her senior.The exhibition, Maya Ruiz-Picasso, daughter of Pablo,runs until 31 December and includes his many portraits of Maya, personal possessions and photographs, along with the sketchbooks and origami sculptures, which are being shown for the first time.Whether the origami birds were made from invitation cards for his own exhibitions is unclear. The granddaughter said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to open his work.‚ÄùIn the exhibition‚Äôs accompanying book, she writes: ‚ÄúWho has never heard it said when looking at a canvas by Picasso, ‚ÄòA child could have done that!‚Äô Many of the artistic revolutions of the 20th century were greeted with mockery and scandal, it is true, but in Picasso‚Äôs case there is a hint of truth in that judgment. As Maya, his first daughter, recalls, ‚Äòthe mystery of life, and therefore of childhood, always filled that father of mine with interest‚Äô.‚ÄùShe adds: ‚ÄúSeeking a pictorial language that would break with the exhausted codes of academic realism, Picasso borrowed extensively from the unruly lines of children‚Äôs drawings. Where Van Gogh, Gauguin and Matisse concentrated on the graphic and pictorial naivety with which children draw, Picasso emphasised more the elements that upset figurative traditions, that is to say, distortion and deformity.‚ÄùDidier Ottinger, deputy director of the Mus√©e national d‚Äôart moderne, Centre Pompidou, is currently staging a Picasso exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia, a collaboration with the Mus√©e Picasso-Paris. Noting that these sketchbooks reflect the artist‚Äôs fascination with childhood, he said: ‚ÄúWho learned from who?‚ÄùWord count: 797Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

His words of wisdom bear a resemblance to the life and works of the most important and respected artists of the 20th century. Known for his eccentric style, using geometric shapes in human and other forms, Picasso created more than 20,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics. He pioneered Cubism, an avant-garde art movement that changed the face of European painting and sculpture. Surrealism, too, influenced his style of artistic discipline. A great example of a surrealist-cum-Cubist depiction is in the masterpiece titled Guernica (1937), a painting which laments the Spanish Civil War. Dark colours and monochrome themes depict the hard realities, fear, anguish and sufferings. Besides reorganising figures in multiple abstract forms, Picasso is also credited for inventing constructed sculpture and collage art.Picasso is evergreen, but this year is special as the world will celebrate his 140th birth anniversary in October. And it's a good time to make an acquaintance with the inspiring muses of the famous master. Celebrating the life and art of the genius painter on his 140th birthday this October, an auction of Picasso‚Äôs 11 artworks will be organised by Sotheby's, one of the world's largest brokers of fine and decorative art, jewellery and collectibles. It will be the first time that Sotheby's will host an auction outside of major art hubs such as London and New York. The auction on October 23 will display Picasso‚Äôs career, and a highly curated selection of paintings, works on paper, and ceramics that span more than 50 years of artistic output from 1917 to 1969. The sale will broadcast around the world via a livestream viewable on Sothebys.com. This will be a first-of-its-kind marquee sale from Sotheby‚Äôs and MGM Resorts Fine Art Collection of MGM Resorts, a renowned entertainment company with casinos and hotels. The sale is estimated to fetch over $100 million and is touted as the most valuable auction dedicated to Picasso that has ever been held.The Sotheby‚Äôs auction room will be set up in Las Vegas‚Äô luxury hotel and casino The Bellagio, which is known for its extravagant 3,000 rooms owned by The Blackstone Group. It is operated by MGM Resorts International.Bringing fine art to Las Vegas, MGM Resorts Fine Art Collection, which opened in 1998, houses a classic collection of the master‚Äôs iconic paintings and charming ceramic pieces. MGM‚Äôs historic collection boasts about 900 works by 200 artists, including modern pieces by the likes of Bob Dylan and David Hockney, which adorn the walls of its hotels around the world.While diversity has long been in MGM Resorts‚Äô DNA, Ari Kastrati, MGM Resorts‚Äô chief hospitality officer, feels committed to create an even more inclusive collection that maintains the breadth of the existing portfolio, while giving a greater voice to artists from under-represented communities.Accompanying the auction will be a four-day exhibition of luxury property specially curated by Sotheby‚Äôs, which will feature a selection of the world‚Äôs finest luxury objects, including automobiles, jewellery, watches, handbags, sneakers and more. ‚ÄúAs one of the most famous, beloved and accomplished artists of all time, we couldn‚Äôt imagine anyone better than Picasso to inaugurate this unique art and culture experience,‚Äù said Brooke Lampley, Sotheby‚Äôs chairman and worldwide head of sales for global fine art, in a press statement.Femme au b√©ret rouge-orange (estimate $20-$30 million), one of Picasso‚Äôs defining portraits of Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter (the artist‚Äôs famed muse and lover who inspired many of his most revered portraits of the 1930s) besides portraits like Homme et enfant (estimate $20-$30 million) and Buste d‚Äôhomme (estimate $10-$15 million) will be part of the collection.Homme et enfant encapsulates the artist‚Äôs preoccupation with his life and legacy during the late period of his career. Also included is Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs (estimate $10-$15 million), a museum-quality still life painted by Picasso during the Nazi occupation of Paris in 1942. Several works on paper, including a portrait of the commedia dell‚Äôarte character Pierrot (estimate $2.5-$3.5 million); Nature morte aux fleurs et au compotier (estimate $6-$8 million), an additional wartime still life painted in Paris in 1943; Aigui√®re ‚Äì Visage (estimate $60-$80,000), a ceramic pitcher; and many more are also enlisted for the show.Word count: 709Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Based on the news article provided, I would classify the potential impact on Pablo Picasso's reputation, visibility, and market confidence as:

Classification: High

The article mentions the theft of a $12.4-million sketchbook from a Paris museum, which is likely to generate significant attention and interest in Picasso's work. The mention of the artist's name in the headline and throughout the article will increase his visibility among collectors, galleries, and the general public. The potential for theft and loss of valuable artwork may also create a sense of exclusivity and rarity around Picasso's work, which could boost market confidence in his work as a sound investment. Additionally, the article does not mention any elements that might drive speculative buying, such as upcoming exhibitions or celebrity endorsements.",

Pablo Picasso masterpiece up for grabs for the price of a raffle ticket,Telegraph.co.uk,15 Dec 2019,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitBecoming an artist was the gamble of a lifetime for Pablo Picasso, who in the early days poverty and obscurity was forced to burn his own paintings just to stay warm.But the Spanish genius rose from provincial penury to be the doyen of the Parisian art world, and ultimately harnessed his talent and international fame to aid the oppressed.His family are now calling on the British people to also take a risk and, with their famed love of a flutter, gamble on the chance to win one of the great painter‚Äôs ¬£1 million works for the cost of a raffle ticket.The Cubist pioneer's descendants hope a Picasso could hang in a UK living room following a new prize draw, which seeks to raise almost ¬£20 million for charity this Christmas.Anyone who can front the cost of a ¬£80 ([Euro]100) ticket could win a signed painting donated for the draw, and Picasso‚Äôs family are counting on the UK show solidarity with the painter, and indulge in a bet.‚ÄúPeople are able to spend one million, ten million, or one hundred million,‚Äù the artist's grandson Olivier Picasso told The Daily Telegraph.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the price of an emotion, it‚Äôs really something that you can feel when you are facing an artwork, in a museum or an art gallery.‚ÄúBut this time maybe it‚Äôs a chance to have it in your living room.‚ÄùThe Frenchman explained the temptation of this prospect to British art lovers: ‚ÄúGambling is your national sport.‚ÄùThe vast canvass of Guernica was toured around the world to highlight an atrocity in the Spanish Civil War, as Picasso belatedly politicised his genius to help others. It is hoped that his paintings can again be put to use outside elegant galleries, this time for the impoverished communities of AfricaA 1921 work, titled Nature Morte, featuring an obscured newspaper, has been selected for this task. The painting, valued at ¬£1 million, will be the prize for the charity draw, which anyone can enter for the cost of a ticket. Proceeds will be invested in securing clean water.‚ÄúMy grandfather was very concerned about helping people,‚Äù said his grandson, the child of the painter‚Äôs daughter Maya. ‚ÄúHe was very poor when he left Spain to come to Paris. He was obliged to burn some paintings just to put something in the fireplace.‚ÄúI think he would have been very happy, I hope he would have been proud.‚ÄùOlivier‚Äôs uncle Claude Picasso called the Christmas project: ‚ÄúA way for our family to continue Picasso's own commitment to the poor.‚ÄùThe 1 Picasso for 100 Euros project is set to become an annual event, which inverts the soaring prices of the painter‚Äôs work, making them accessible, and wedded to charity.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs quite revolutionary,‚Äù organiser Peri Cochin said in the Picasso Museum in Paris, where the prize painting currently hangs.It is hoped British generosity could see it travel across the Channel.Ms Cochin said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in their genes: if they can do something nice, I‚Äôm sure they can do it.‚ÄùShe added on British tastes: ‚ÄúThey bet on everything. Who‚Äôs going to win the football, everything.‚ÄúHere you have the generosity, and the chance to win a great piece from a great painter.‚ÄùIt is hoped that the 200,000 available raffle tickets will be sold to generate almost ¬£20 million for Care, which with numeric neatness with help 200,000 people in Cameroon, Madagascar and Morocco.Philippe Leveque, managing director of Care France, believes people can stand in charitable comradeship with the great artist.""This is a chain of solidarity with Picasso,"" he said.The draw for the competition will take place at Christie's in Paris on January 6.

Over the past five years, experts from The Phillips Collection, National Gallery of Art, Cornell University and Delaware's Winterthur Museum have developed a clearer image of the mystery picture under the surface.It is a portrait of an unknown man painted in a vertical composition by one of the 20th century's great artists.""It's really one of those moments that really makes what you do special,"" said Patricia Favero, the conservator at The Phillips Collection who pieced together the best infrared image yet of the man's face. ""The second reaction was, 'well, who is it?' We're still working on answering that question.""In 2008, improved infrared imagery revealed for the first time a man's bearded face resting on his hand with three rings on his fingers. He is dressed in a jacket and bow tie. A technical analysis confirmed the hidden portrait is a work Picasso likely painted just before ""The Blue Room,"" curators said.After the portrait was discovered, conservators have been using other technology to scan the painting for further insights.Conservators long suspected there might be something under the surface of ""The Blue Room,"" which has been part of The Phillips Collection in Washington since 1927.Brushstrokes on the piece clearly do not match the composition that depicts a woman bathing in Picasso's studio. A conservator noted the odd brushstrokes in a 1954 letter, but it was not until the 1990s that an x-ray of the painting first revealed a fuzzy image of something under the picture. It was not clear, though, that it was a portrait.""When he had an idea, you know, he just had to get it down and realise it,"" curator Susan Behrends Frank told the AP, revealing Picasso had hurriedly painted over another complete picture. ""He could not afford to acquire new canvasses every time he had an idea that he wanted to pursue. He worked sometimes on cardboard because canvass was so much more expensive.""Scholars are researching who this man might be and why Picasso painted him. They have ruled out the possibility that it was a self-portrait. One possible figure is the Paris art dealer Ambrose Villard who hosted Picasso's first show in 1901. But there is no documentation and no clues left on the canvass, so the research continues.Favero has been collaborating with other experts to scan the painting with multi-spectral imaging technology and x-ray fluorescence intensity mapping to try to identify and map the colours of the hidden painting. They would like to recreate a digital image approximating the colours Picasso used.Curators are planning the first exhibit focused on ""The Blue Room"" as a seminal work in Picasso's career for 2017. It will examine the revelation of the man's portrait beneath the painting, as well as other Picasso works and his engagement with other artists.For now, ""The Blue Room"" is part of a tour to South Korea up to early 2015 as the research continues.Hidden pictures have been found under other important Picasso paintings. A technical analysis of ""La Vie"" at the Cleveland Museum of Art revealed Picasso significantly reworked the painting's composition. And conservators found a portrait of a moustached man beneath Picasso's painting ""Woman Ironing"" at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.Dorothy Kosinski, the director of The Phillips Collection, said new knowledge about Picasso and his process can be discovered through the hi-tech collaboration among museums.""Our audiences are hungry for this. It's kind of detective work. It's giving them a doorway of access that I think enriches, maybe adds mystery, while allowing them to be part of a piecing together of a puzzle,"" she said. ""The more we can understand, the greater our appreciation is of its significance in Picasso's life.""Edited by Barney HendersonWord count: 715Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The paintings from this period were dismissed at the time as bordering on the pornographic and symptomatic of an artist who was past his best. However they were reappraised after Picasso's death in 1973, particularly when the Royal Academy included several of his late works alongside paintings by Lucien Freud and Howard Hodgkin in a 1981 exhibition called A New Spirit In Painting.Fountain by Marcel DuchampOne of the most iconic and infamous works of 20th century art, French surrealist artist Marcel Duchamp found a urinal in 1917, signed it ""R Mutt"" and tried to exhibit it at the New York-based Society Of Independent Artists. It was rejected. The original Fountain is now lost but in 1964 Duchamp cast eight more: Daskalopoulos has number five, purchased for pound(s)1.1 million in 1999 and the only one still in private hands. ""A really iconic and really famous image that has tested the boundaries of what contemporary art and conceptual art could be and has been hugely influential,"" says senior curator Lucy Askew.Cremaster by Matthew BarneyThe Californian artist's five-strong Cremaster Cycle of films has been called one of the masterpieces of avant-garde cinema. Shot non-sequentially between 1994 and 2002 (Barney started with Cremaster 4 and finished with Cremaster 3) they vary in length from three hours to one and the artist has made them unavailable to buy on DVD. All of them will be shown in the Edinburgh exhibition, however, screened on five monitors arranged in a pentagram around five vitrines - cases, basically - in which Barney has arranged sculptural objects related to each of the films. Barney now lives in New York with his partner, Icelandic singer Bjork.La Poupee by Hans BellmerThe German Surrealist began making fetishistic, sexualised life-size female dolls in the early 1930s. Typically he would photograph them arranged in various poses and in 1934 published a book (anonymously) featuring 10 of these stark, unsettling images. During the war he made fake passports for the French Resistance and later gave up doll-making to concentrate on making sexually-explicit photographs and erotic drawings. The photograph on display in the exhibition was once owned by Andre Breton, a leading light in the Surrealist movement, and shows the second doll Bellmer made, from 1935.Word count: 399Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The granddaughter of Pablo Picasso has discovered an extraordinary collection of sketchbooks used by the artist to teach his eldest daughter to draw and colour.Picasso filled the pages with playful scenes ‚Äì animals, birds, clowns, acrobats, horses and doves ‚Äì which would delight any child, as well as adults.He created them for Maya Ruiz-Picasso when she was aged between five and seven. On some pages, the little girl made impressive attempts to imitate the master. She also graded her father‚Äôs work, scribbling the number ‚Äú10‚Äù on a circus scene, to show her approval.He drew two charming images of a fox longing for grapes ‚Äì inspired by the 17th-century fabulist Jean de La Fontaine‚Äôs sour grapes fable, The Fox and the Grapes ‚Äì and Maya coloured in one of them. He also drew simple but beautiful eagles in a single movement, without raising the pencil from the paper, conveying his love of form and pure line to her.The previously unseen collection includes exquisite origami sculptures of birds that he brought to life for Maya from exhibition invitation cards.His granddaughter, Diana Widmaier-Ruiz-Picasso, found the works by chance while looking through family material in storage. Intrigued, she showed them to her mother, now 86, for whom memories came flooding back.Widmaier-Ruiz-Picasso told the Observer : ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòOf course, those are my sketchbooks when I was little‚Äô. We tend to be very visual in the family so immediately she was plunged into that time. It was a very moving moment, not only because you‚Äôre talking about one of the greatest artists but also because it made it very human. I was excited. Then I was moved.‚ÄùPicasso, who died in 1973, had been taught to draw by his father, a professor of drawing, ‚Äúso that was something natural for him to do‚Äù with Maya, his granddaughter said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a beautiful page where he‚Äôs drawing a bowl and she‚Äôs drawing a bowl.‚ÄúSometimes she‚Äôs making an image and he‚Äôs doing another, showing her the right way to do it. Sometimes they would depict different scenes. Other times, he would draw a dog or a hat. Sometimes he‚Äôs using the whole page to draw one particular thing. Other times, he‚Äôs depicting certain scenes, scenes of the circus. It‚Äôs very interesting.‚ÄùMaya particularly remembers that, during the second world war, colour pencils and notebooks were in short supply: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably why my father wrote in my exercise books and coloured with my pencils. I still have fond memories of those moments when we met up in the kitchen to draw together. It was the only place in the apartment where it was warm.‚ÄùWidmaier-Ruiz-Picasso is an art historian, curator and jewellery designer, who has just published her latest book, Picasso Sorcier, exploring his superstitions and belief in magic.She described the discovery of the sketchbooks as ‚Äúfortuitous‚Äù because she was co-curating a major exhibition for the Mus√©e Picasso-Paris on his close bond with his first daughter, born of his passionate love for Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, whom he met in 1927 when she was just 17 and he was 28 years her senior.The exhibition, Maya Ruiz-Picasso, daughter of Pablo,runs until 31 December and includes his many portraits of Maya, personal possessions and photographs, along with the sketchbooks and origami sculptures, which are being shown for the first time.Whether the origami birds were made from invitation cards for his own exhibitions is unclear. The granddaughter said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to open his work.‚ÄùIn the exhibition‚Äôs accompanying book, she writes: ‚ÄúWho has never heard it said when looking at a canvas by Picasso, ‚ÄòA child could have done that!‚Äô Many of the artistic revolutions of the 20th century were greeted with mockery and scandal, it is true, but in Picasso‚Äôs case there is a hint of truth in that judgment. As Maya, his first daughter, recalls, ‚Äòthe mystery of life, and therefore of childhood, always filled that father of mine with interest‚Äô.‚ÄùShe adds: ‚ÄúSeeking a pictorial language that would break with the exhausted codes of academic realism, Picasso borrowed extensively from the unruly lines of children‚Äôs drawings. Where Van Gogh, Gauguin and Matisse concentrated on the graphic and pictorial naivety with which children draw, Picasso emphasised more the elements that upset figurative traditions, that is to say, distortion and deformity.‚ÄùDidier Ottinger, deputy director of the Mus√©e national d‚Äôart moderne, Centre Pompidou, is currently staging a Picasso exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia, a collaboration with the Mus√©e Picasso-Paris. Noting that these sketchbooks reflect the artist‚Äôs fascination with childhood, he said: ‚ÄúWho learned from who?‚ÄùWord count: 797Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

It opens up his life,"" he said.Picasso has often been condemned as a macho misogynist, whose sex drive and selfishness left a trail of destruction behind him - with Marie-Therese, his second wife Jacqueline Roque and a grandson all committing suicide.But curator Emilia Philippot said the documents show a more nuanced view of his relationship with Olga, with one home movie showing her plucking daisy petals and mouthing the words, ""He loves me, he loves me not.""'Very mysterious woman'""She is a very mysterious woman. In his portraits and photos of her she does not smile a lot... but when you see her in the films she is actually very joyous and girl-like. She's a dancer and she is always dressing up and being playful with the dogs.""Ruiz-Picasso said it emerged from her letters that Olga had good reason to be sad and preoccupied.Born in what is now Ukraine, her father - a colonel in the Russian imperial army - had disappeared in the chaos of the Bolshevik revolution.While she and Picasso were climbing the social ladder in Paris, her family was losing everything.Picasso idealised Olga on canvas as the model of perfect motherhood after the birth of their son Paulo in 1921, but soon the relationship began to go wrong.""She was known for her fits of jealousy and obviously there were some real tensions within the relationship,"" Philippot said.""But I think Picasso had love and respect for her. He too was a prisoner of their situation, which he expressed in comparing himself to the Minotaur,"" the imprisoned mythological half-man half bull.The couple separated in 1935, but still financially dependent on him, ""Olga had real trouble accepting the separation"", Philippot added.""She was very alone and she suffered a lot. After the war when Picasso settled in the south of France, Olga followed him, going from hotel to hotel, living out of her suitcase,"" while Paulo became his father's chauffeur.""She would send Picasso little cards with photographs of Paulo and the grandchildren as if they were still a family.""But Picasso ""never replied to her letters"" and wanted nothing of the reconciliation and conventional family life that Olga craved.Dismissed as ""mad"" by many of Picasso's friends, she died from cancer in the French Mediterranean resort of Cannes in 1955. Four years later Picasso married Roque, who he painted obsessively until his death in 1973.The exhibition runs until September 3.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at htsyndication@hindustantimes.comWord count: 775Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

After his apprentice years in Barcelona and Madrid, he moved to France in 1901. Blue Period: Youthful angst, the penury of a budding artist and the suicide of friend Carlos Casagemas were the triggers for the series of paintings that are characterised by a bluish tinge (1901-04). The subjects are quintessentially social outcasts -- poor labourers, beggars and prostitutes. The tone is melancholic and there is a sense of fatigue and loneliness. Though Picasso found it difficult to sell his paintings then, the Blue Period works now are extremely prized. Rose Period: With time, Picasso found his footing and a mistress (""la belle Fernande"") in Paris and slowly his depression dissipated. The subjects are still solitary but the overall impression is one of hope and joy. There is a preponderance of orange and pink tones. The subjects are, for the most part, drawn from circus life. Harlequin is also a recurring motif. The lines become more refined and elegant. Picasso, as a master of figurative art, reaches his peak during this period. The Rose Period ends in 1906. African Period: From 1907 to 1909, Picasso's art took an abrupt turn. The colours remained orange and pink with the addition of brown. But the form changed drastically. Inspired by African art, Picasso's paintings became flatter, angular and distorted. These works were also emotionally charged. Part of his fascination for ""tribal"" art was Picasso's attempt at trying to break the shackles imposed by prevalent artistic norms. Cubism: The -ism that Picasso is intrinsically associated with. Cubism is important in that it breaks away from centuries-old method of perceiving objects. Its defining feature is multiplicity of views. Picasso's paintings during this period have objects that are stylised and fragmented. He was experimenting with space and how to fit in a three-dimensional point of view on a two-dimensional canvas. Classicism & Surrealism: By 1919, Picasso had moved away from cubism and returned to the classical forms. The upheavals of World War I and a steady domestic life may have prodded him to ""return to order"". However, his was not a step back. Though he borrowed heavily from Greek and Roman traditions, his work was infused with both cubist and surrealist tropes. The human body remains distorted. An interesting motif in his paintings during this period is the introduction of the minotaur. Later Works: Post World War II, Picasso merged a number of styles in his work. He also revisited the Old Masters and cross-referenced them. A major theme of his later works was the investigation of the artist and his persona. And, of course, there were paintings inspired by the women in his life. Some of his drawings are marked by their simplicity, an attempt to return to childhood innocence. Besides sculpture, which he had been doing for many years, Picasso delved into ceramics and printmaking. Painter's Politics ""No, painting is not made to decorate apartments. It's an offensive and defensive weapon against the enemy,"" Picasso famously said. Till death, he remained a member of the French Communist Party, which he joined in 1944. However, his relationship with the party was ambivalent. In an interview, he said: ""I am a communist and my painting is communist painting. ... But if I were a shoemaker, royalist or communist or anything else, I would not necessarily hammer my shoes in a special way to show my politics."" Picasso's peace dove, Guernica, The Charnel House and Massacre in Korea are totems for peaceniks, the world over. Muse & Mistress ""Love is the greatest refreshment of life,"" he once said. And, true to his words, had a string of mistresses besides his two wives. The other famous quote attributed to him is: ""There are only two types of women -- goddesses and doormats."" A look at the eight women who inspired him. 1. Fernande OlivierPicasso's first long-term love interest, she was his muse from 1904 to 1911. Red-haired and voluptuous, Olivier was an artist's model. She left Picasso because of his overbearing nature and his refusal to allow her to model for other artists. Author of Loving Picasso. 2. Eva GouelAfter Olivier walked out on him, Picasso retaliated with a relationship with one of her friends. Not much is known of Gouel, who was frail and ill and died of tuberculosis in 1915. And while she lay dying, the priapic Picasso had a short affair with one Gaby Lespinasse. 3. Olga KoklovaNext came the dark-haired Russian ballerina, his first wife. A smitten Picasso proposed and they married in 1918. Koklova was a bourgeois and loved the high life. Picasso felt uncomfortable in those surroundings and cracks appeared in the relationship. They never divorced though. She died of cancer in 1955. 4. Marie-Therese WalterAs his marriage deteriorated, Picasso found solace in the 17-year-old blonde. When they first met on the streets of Paris, he reportedly told her: ""I am Picasso. You and I are going to do great things together."" Their affair lasted from 1927 to 1936. She committed suicide in 1977. 5. Dora MaarAnd then walked in the gifted half-French, half-Croat photographer. She was politically aware and intellectually at par with Picasso. Till 1944, she was his companion and mistress, only to suffer a nervous breakdown due to his constant infidelities. 6. Francoise GilotThe painter wooed this 21-year-old law student for months before she agreed to become his lover. She was also an aspiring painter. But life with Picasso was difficult. Domestic drudgery and Picasso's famous philandering made her depressed. She finally left him in 1953. Later she went on to marry Jonas Salk, the discoverer of polio vaccine. Wrote Life with Picasso. 7. Genevieve Laporte Around 1951 the 70-year-old Picasso met the 24-year-old poet. Though they were lovers, she refused to move in with him. Their relationship was kept a secret. She left him for a Greek man in 1953. 8. Jacqueline RoqueStung by the double whammy, a dejected Picasso moped around Cote d'Azur bars. Till he spotted the green-eyed, black-haired sales assistant. She was 27, he 72. He wooed her for six months before she became his mistress. She called him god; he reciprocated by making nearly 400 paintings of her. They married in 1961. She shot herself in 1986.

A reception is planned for Wednesday, Oct. 2, at 5:30 p.m. The works reveal the Spanish artist's mastery of the printmaking process and ""functions as a visual diary of his creative thinking and preoccupations during a pivotal moment in his career,"" said Michael Taylor, director of the Hood Museum. ""These works illustrate the two worlds to which Picasso owed allegiance at this time, namely the harmony and order of classical art and the surrealist world of dreams and the imagination."" Named after Ambroise Vollard, the famed French art dealer who gave Picasso (1881-1973) his first exhibition in Paris in 1901, these 100 etchings are shown at the Hood Museum alongside works by Rembrandt and Goya that inspired Picasso.The dominant motif of the ""Vollard Suite"" is the sculptor in his studio, a theme that had biographical overtones for the artist, who in 1932 established a sculpture workshop in the stables of the Chateau du Boisgeloup northwest of Paris. Many of these etchings were inspired by the sculptures he completed at his country house between 1932 and 1934. The artist appears in the guise of a classical hero bearded, nude and crowned with an ivy wreath and often accompanied by a beautiful young girl who resembles Picasso's lover, Marie-Therese Walter, as they relax and gaze at his recent sculptural creations. Another theme is the minotaur, the threatening half-man, half-bull from Greek mythology. They build upon Picasso's earlier iconography of the bullfight to create a personal and political allegory. The four prints representing a pitiful, sightless and impotent minotaur guided by a young girl holding flowers or a dove are redolent of tragedy and suffering. They were informed by the darkening political situation in Europe during the 1930s, as well as Picasso's fear of blindness, which haunted him from his earliest days as an artist. The exhibition will also include the final and most important state of Picasso's 1935 etching ""Minotauromachy,"" on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Hood presents the complementary exhibition ""Cubism and Its Legacy."" Developed between 1908 and 1914 by Picasso and Georges Braque, the style represented an illusionistic window into a changing global landscape. Cubism shattered preconceived notions about vision, asserted the flatness of the picture plane and the materiality of paint, and presented subjects from various perspectives and planes at the same time.Word count: 419Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Soon after his arrival in Montmartre, the bohemian heart of the city, Picasso caught the attention of art dealers and quickly found a market for his work.‚ÄúHe was catching, he was feeding his art with his surroundings, every time,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúSometimes he reacted, sometimes he absorbed, but he was always connected.‚ÄùBut his radical shifts in style spoke to the fearless and inventive Picasso‚Äôs determination to do things his way.‚ÄúHe said his paintings were not made to please the collectors,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúHe used to say, ‚ÄòA painting is a weapon.‚Äô He used it against the world, against the taste of collectors. This man was always fighting.‚ÄùWith each change, Picasso also battled public perceptions.‚ÄúWhen you consider the great artists, there is usually a subtle evolution,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúThis is not the case with Picasso. He chose a type of expression, and would go deep into this expression, then delete it, and change to something quite the opposite.‚ÄùThe most spectacular example of Picasso‚Äôs ability to switch was his move from cubism, which he co-invented, to neoclassicism. The change was inspired by a trip to Rome where he met and fell in love with a ballerina, who became his first wife.‚ÄúIt was (initially) difficult when he made cubism because nobody knew what it was about,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúBut he had many followers and it became an important movement. Then he became classical, and it was a shock. But again, people were following and saying, ‚ÄòOK‚Äô. Then he became surrealist, and then something else until the very end.‚ÄùPicasso‚Äôs ability to adapt and absorb caused ire among his peers, mainly because they saw him as a very talented threat.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a drama to have a man like Picasso (around). He was so gifted,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúIf you were an artist at that time, and you had an idea, and the idea was expressed in an exhibition or studio, Picasso would see it, catch it and make it better. It was very upsetting.‚ÄùIn his final years, and at the absolute height of his fame, Picasso was misunderstood and unpopular.‚ÄúIt was a very paradoxical moment for him because he was the most famous man on Earth,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúHe used to say he was as famous as Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe, but his art was not considered important. He was a man from the old world.‚ÄùYet, by his disruptive nature, Picasso was on trend by being off trend. As the art world turned to New York and abstract expression, Picasso went back to figurative painting.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably his most interesting work,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúHe was not understood at all. He was 80 years old, and completely out of fashion. To the art word, he didn‚Äôt exist.‚ÄùOttinger arrived in Melbourne earlier this week to prepare for the exhibition opening. He says the task of shipping priceless Picasso works to Australia has been monumental.The essential works that will go on display include The Weeping Woman (1937), Mother and Child (1907), The Matador (1970), The Violin (1914), and many more.‚ÄúThe works are so important in terms of value,‚Äù Ottinger says, with obvious understatement. ‚ÄúWe had to fracture the shipment.‚ÄùThe paintings were flown to Melbourne in eight different planes, presumably to avoid a fine art catastrophe, with each plane including high security.Ottinger doesn‚Äôt hesitate when asked to choose the most significant work in the exhibition. He nominates two.First, The Matador from Picasso‚Äôs series of large canvases depicting sword-brandishing musketeers, for its free thinking and humour.His second pick is The Weeping Woman, which was acquired by the NGV in 1985 and famously stolen from the gallery walls in August 1986 by a group calling itself the Australian Cultural Terrorists.Initially, the bandits demanded a ransom, but quickly turned the heist into a dialogue about arts funding, and a platform to hurl insults at the-then Victorian Arts Minister Race Mathews.Two weeks later, after a tip off to police, The Weeping Woman was found undamaged in a locker at Spencer St railway station.The crime was not solved, but investigators suspected it was an ‚Äúinside job‚Äù involving culprits from the art world.‚ÄúA work can become a masterpiece in such a story you have with The Weeping Woman,‚Äù Ottinger says. ‚ÄúIt was stolen, it came back, and now it‚Äôs an important painting to everyone because of this story.‚ÄùDiana Widmaier-Picasso hopes audiences see the humanity in Picasso‚Äôs work.‚ÄúHe understood life and death, and he was affected and influenced by these crucial moments,‚Äù she says.She knows the weight of expectation that comes with her family name.‚ÄúThere is a great responsibility that comes with the name Picasso.‚ÄúPeople are still fascinated by, and devote their lives to Pablo Picasso.‚ÄúThe blessings are, he had so many admirers,‚Äù she says, then adds quickly: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any curses. There are no downsides‚Äù.ngv.vic.gov.auPicasso‚Äôs must-see works at the NGVThe Matador (1970)The Weeping Woman (1937)Mother and Child (1907)The Violin (1914)Source: Didier OttingerThe noble art of homageAlmost 50 years after Pablo Picasso‚Äôs death, artists continue to be inspired by his creations, the movements he spearheaded, and the way he worked.Three Australian artists ‚Äì sculptor Sann√© Mestrom, painter Kirsty Budge, and set designer and photographer Georgina Cue ‚Äì have shared with V Weekend how the Spanish master has influenced their works and careers.Sann√© MestromSann√© Mestrom has created a series of sculptures inspired by Pablo Picasso‚Äôs Weeping Woman paintings ‚Äì but her homages are ‚Äúnot without critique‚Äù.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a double-edged sword, my love of Picasso,‚Äù the Blue Mountains-based conceptual sculptor says.‚ÄúWhile he was progressive in some areas, he was not progressive in his representation of women.‚ÄúHe would often depict his mistress, Dora Maar, crying and in anguish. I wanted to pull her out of the canvas.‚ÄùMestrom‚Äôs breakout 2013 work titled Dora Maar achieves this ‚Äì Maar, who was also an artist, towers as a 3.5m-tall aluminium water fountain sculpture.Tears still spill from a large bronze eyeball in the work commissioned by the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, but Mestrom notes Maar ‚Äúis force‚Äù rather than being ‚Äúcompressed into a paining‚Äù. The Netherlands-born artist, who was based in Victoria for 20 years before recently shifting north, continued her feminist revision of the Weeping Woman with three concrete sculptures titled Weeping Women the following year.‚ÄúThey went further into that idea of reclaiming the female body, (and) women controlling their own space,‚Äù she says.Mestrom says while her work contains criticism of Picasso, it also holds ‚Äúa lot of respect‚Äù.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not by accident he‚Äôs such a household name ‚Äì he really was enormously pivotal in the modernist history of art,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúHe popularised the breakaway of art‚Äôs responsibility to document life ‚Äì the camera was invented around the time he found his feet, (so) art didn‚Äôt have to assume that role ‚Äì and paved the way for a much more experimental approach.‚ÄùArt could exist just for art‚Äôs sake, to challenge the mind and challenge our assumptions.‚ÄùGeorgina CueWorking out of her parents‚Äô Ivanhoe garage, Georgina Cue has brought an artistic movement that was spearheaded by Pablo Picasso a century ago into the modern day.The artist uses everyday materials to create eye-catching sets in that garage, which she then photographs and exhibits as photos.Cue says she has drawn from ‚Äú20th-century art historical and cinematic moments‚Äù since starting this body of work six years ago. And the synthetic cubist movement developed by Picasso and his contemporary, Georges Braque, informed her 2021 exhibition, Pictures.Art historians note Picasso‚Äôs Guitar series displays the transition from the first period of cubism, analytical, to the synthetic period. Cue says the latter discarded the need for three dimensions to ‚Äúflatten‚Äù spaces in artworks, while also using ‚Äúsimple shapes and bright colours‚Äù.Collage was also invented during this period, with Picasso and Braque both incorporating real items into works from 1912.In her creations for Pictures ‚Äì including Mandolin and Guitar, and Still Life with Yellow Vase ‚Äì Cue directly references the Guitar series, uses real-life objects and bold colours, and plays ‚Äúwith the idea of flattening space using sculpture and photography‚Äù.‚ÄúAs someone interested in 20th-century art history, and in light, colour, depth of field, set design, and interiors, ‚Ä¶ synthetic cubism is the perfect template,‚Äù Cue says.‚ÄúI‚Äôd been accruing hundreds of images of paintings by Picasso and Braque from the period between 1912-1914 and I wanted to create a series of still lifes, to push the colour I was using (and) I also really wanted to explore playing more with depths of field.‚ÄùThe fact Picasso created cubist costumes and sets for the Ballets Russes appealed to Cue further ‚Äúas an artist who looks asset design‚Äù.Kirsty BudgeAbbotsford-based artist Kirsty Budge returned from a month in Europe in 2016, in which she saw all of Pablo Picasso‚Äôs ‚Äúhits‚Äù, inspired to paint.His museums in Barcelona and Paris were on Budge‚Äôs itinerary. And seeing his anti-war masterpiece, Guernica, at Madrid‚Äôs Museo Reina Sofia was the highlight, moving Budge to tears.‚ÄúI was in awe,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs a painter, (that) has had the biggest impact on me.‚ÄúHe was so prolific ‚Äì he‚Äôs just sprinkled everywhere.‚ÄùShe continues: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inspiring because (you can see) a life‚Äôs work of paintings. You see someone move through ideas, what they‚Äôre going through in their life. You also see the community he was part of.‚ÄùBudge ‚Äì who won last year‚Äôs Arthur Guy Memorial Painting Prize for lockdown-inspired painting OK, so is this a fresh hell or are we just adding to the regular one today? ‚Äì says lessons from this trip have since permeated her own career.‚ÄúPicasso‚Äôs work has given me the permission ‚Ä¶ to be cheeky, to challenge, to question or to explore different visual realities,‚Äù Budge says.‚ÄúPicasso‚Äôs work has taught me how to understand the process of thinking in images, tones and forms, how to deconstruct ideas and to think in a visual way, while being aware of what has come before us and thinking how we can acknowledge and expand on that.‚ÄúPicasso made the work he wanted to see. The bold freedom ‚Ä¶ has been very influential to me.‚ÄùThere was one clear lowlight of the trip for Budge: there weren‚Äôt enough paintings by women in the museums she visited.‚ÄúThere were a few scattered here and there,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúThere was one painting by a woman at (Paris‚Äôs Centre) Pompidou, by Natalia Goncharova.‚ÄúI was captivated by the work, it felt bold and soft at the same time. The impact of seeing that work for the first time still hasn‚Äôt left me.‚ÄùThat painting, Les Porteuses, later directly influenced Budge‚Äôs 2017 piece OK I‚Äôm gonna need you to tone it down, I love you but you‚Äôre being a lot.Word count: 2118Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

"Pablo Picasso, Marlon Brando, Bubbles the chimp: 10 amazing Quincy Jones stories",Telegraph.co.uk,09 Feb 2018,"Full TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation| Jump to first hitQuincy Jones is 84 years old and has, at least reported count, 29 Grammy Awards, 22 girlfriends and countless stories concerning nearly every famous person you could mention - including Adolf Hitler. He believes he‚Äôll live until he‚Äôs 110, and still spends his days engaged in music (he rates Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamarr and Ed Sheeran, but has little time for Taylor Swift ), business (he‚Äôs working on a project that purports to be like Netflix, but for old jazz footage) and the dissemination of grade A-level gossip.Most recently, Jones caused a sensation by revealing that he had dated 24-year-old Ivanka Trump (when he was 72) - although he still considers her father ‚Äùa crazy m---------. Limited mentally - a megalomaniac, narcissistic‚Äù. He also wasted little time in dismissing The Beatles as ‚ÄúThe worst musicians in the world.‚ÄùJones‚Äôs life story - from the poverty-stricken son of a schizophrenic mother and mob-related father to most influential man in pop - has won comparisons to that of fictional character Forrest Gump so often he‚Äôs coined his own moniker: ‚Äúthe Ghetto Gump‚Äù. Kidada, one of his six daughters of seven children, prefers LL ‚ÄúLoose Lips‚Äù QJ. Here are some of his greatest stories.1. Bubbles, Michael Jackson‚Äôs chimpanzee, bit Rashida JonesRashida Jones is now known as the Emmy-nominated producer of provocative Netflix documentaries about the porn industry and series regular in comedy Parks and Rec. But she is also Jones‚Äôs fifth child (with actress Peggy Lipton, his third wife), and she grew up in his world. In the early 1980s, that meant hanging out with Michael Jackson, whose records helped Jones become a star, and Jackson‚Äôs ever-expanding coterie of animals.There was Muscles, the boa constrictor, who terrified Jones when he snaked across the console in the studio and ate Jackson‚Äôs parrot - ‚Äúand here this cat, man, is hanging out of the parrot cage. His mouth is inside, but he just ate the parrot so he couldn't get out of the cage. So he's just hanging there till he digests it,‚Äù as Jones recalled - and Bubbles, the King of Pop‚Äôs pet chimpanzee. Jones wasn‚Äôt a fan: ‚ÄúHe was a pain in the ass,‚Äù he told GQ. ‚ÄúHe bit Rashida. My poor baby.""2. Adolf Hitler, and the rest of the Nazis, were fuelled by cocaineEven now, Jones makes no bones about the affection he holds for Leni Riefenstahl, best known for making propaganda films for the Nazis, including the Triumph of the Will. Jones considers her ‚Äúone of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived‚Äù and Riefenstahl was so enamoured with his work that, when he was in Berlin with Nastassja Kinski - his partner in the early Nineties, and mother to his two youngest children - he was invited to dine with her.During that lunch, Jones learned several things, including that she used 211 cameras (‚Äúthink I'm going to tell Hitler, ""One more time, Adolf!""?) and that ‚Äúeverybody in the Third Reich was on cocaine‚Äù. The revelation ‚Äúreally hit home‚Äù for Jones because he ‚Äúknew all about her‚Äù, and remains convinced that ‚Äúshe was Goebbels‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äù - although historians attest otherwise.3. Nelson Mandela tried to make him touch a cheetahIn 1997, Jones joined the then-South African President Nelson Mandela on Blue Train, a five-star hotel on rails that had been luxuriously refitted. The super-producer was on a starry guestlist that included Jemima and Imran Khan, Mia Farrow and Naomi Campbell. Whether it was during this trip or an earlier one, Jones didn‚Äôt specify, but GQ did print an intriguing aside in their January interview with Jones about ‚Äúthe time Nelson Mandela tried to get him to touch a cheetah‚Äù. All we know? That Quincy ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù.4. Tupac dissed him, then proposed to his daughterTupac Shakur & fianc√©e Kidada Jones. pic.twitter.com/UzNBkoKGPm- boqor riya. (@hausofriya) March 26, 2015In 1993, Tupac Shakur lambasted Jones - not for his musical efforts, but his fondness for marrying and dating white women and ‚Äúmake f----- up kids‚Äù. The latter slur became particularly awkward considering that the rapper went on to date, live with and become engaged to his daughter Kidada. He even died in her arms after being shot.It was Rashida, however, who fought her father‚Äôs corner, writing a letter addressed to Shakur that read: ‚ÄúTupac, if you learn one lesson, let it be that at least my father took the time to look at how f----- up life would be if he didn‚Äôt get his s--- together early on. I don‚Äôt see you Ô¨Åghting for your race. In my opinion, you‚Äôre destroying it and s------- all over your people.‚ÄùJones remembers the first time Kidada and Shakur met, when the three of them were in a deli. ‚ÄúHe was hitting on her‚Ä¶ And I went over the back of the seat and did like that on his shoulders: 'Pac!' And then I said, 'Come here, m-------, I've got to talk to you.' And we went and talked, and after that we hugged and made up."" Shakur apologised to Jones, and Kidada was smitten. She later described him as ‚Äúthe love of her life‚Äù.5. He was nearly killed in the Manson murdersThe devastating attack of Charles Manson‚Äôs followers at 10050 Cielo Drive in 1969 shook America. Fifty years later, and the murder of Sharon Tate by the cult is still fascinating Hollywood - three films are being released about the incident in 2019 alone. Jay Sebring, Jones‚Äôs hairdresser, was among the victims, and Jones had arranged to meet Steve McQueen at Tate‚Äôs home on the evening of the murders to watch a rough cut of Bullitt. But then Jones forgot. The next morning, he received a call from Bill Cosby, who was calling from London to tell Jones that Sebring was dead, along with the other five guests at Tate‚Äôs home. Jones‚Äôs reaction, looking back over his lucky escape? ‚ÄúThat's the Ghetto Gump s---. Life is a trip, man. Life is a trip.""6. He enjoyed the Pope‚Äôs shoesIt‚Äôs worth knowing, at this juncture, that Jones is good friends with Bono. So good, in fact, that Bono lets him stay in his ‚Äúcastle‚Äù when he visits Ireland, as the country, along with Scotland, is ‚Äúso racist it's frightening‚Äù. Their friendship is the kind that means that when Bono was invited to meet Pope John Paul, he took Jones along. They both dressed the part, along with ‚Äúall the guys in the Vatican‚Äù, with ‚ÄúVatican black shoes‚Äù. But John Paul? ‚ÄúHe had on some burgundy wingtips, man, with thin tan rib socks, man,‚Äù Jones told GQ. ‚ÄúWhen I kissed his hand, I looked down and saw those shoes and it just fell out of my mouth. I said, 'Oh, my man's got some pimp shoes on.' And he heard me.""A brief note on Bono and Jones‚Äôs relationship, though: while Jones is fond of the U2 frontman, a recent interview with Vulture would suggest he is not a fan of the band‚Äôs music.7. Jones and Marlon Brando called each other LeroyJones met Marlon Brando when he was 18. The actor was fresh from A Streetcar Named Desire and was with Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte when they bumped into Jones leaving New York jazz club Birdland. Together, they went up to a club in Harlem - Brando was ‚Äúthe only white dude in the whole place‚Äù - whereupon Brando approached a group of women and their pimp. He asked one to dance, ‚Äúhe‚Äôd dance his ass off‚Äù, and then returned the woman to the group.Brando had, however, in a heightened sense of paranoia after smoking a joint. He thought the pimp was looking at him, and went back to say, ‚ÄúLook, I was a gentleman, man, I came and asked you first, man,‚Äù to which the pimp replied, ‚ÄúThe name ain't ‚Äòman‚Äô, it's ‚ÄòLeroy‚Äô L-E-R-O-m-----------Y.‚ÄùAs Jones recalled: ‚Äúat that, Marlon turned around and freaked out. He got paranoid-got outside and ran 15 blocks, nobody after him. So we called each other Leroy till the day he died.""The incident didn‚Äôt prevent Brando and Jones from enjoying a short lifetime of dancing together, though. Brando would join Jones cha-cha dancing, and offered the producer respite on his island in Tahiti when Jones had a breakdown. Jones also maintains that Brando was an avid bisexual, who would ‚Äúf--- anything. Anthing! He‚Äôd f--- a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.‚Äù8. He has 19 mobile phonesFor an octogenarian, Jones prides himself on his comfort with new technology. What he can‚Äôt get into, though, is enslavement to the smartphone. When The Guardian asked him, in 2014, if he had ‚Äúevery celebrity‚Äôs number on his phone‚Äù, Jones replied: ‚ÄúNo way. I got 19 of them [mobile phones]. I don‚Äôt carry one with me. My security guy handles that. Every minute those suckers go off. It‚Äôs the age of cocoonism.‚ÄùHe went on to explain that Apple send him the latest smartphones, but he doesn‚Äôt want them, for the valid reason that: ‚Äúeverybody on the f----- planet is sitting at home fiddling with their goddam phones.‚Äù9. Frank Sinatra tried to set him up with Marilyn Monroe - and failedSinatra and Quincy met in suitably glitzy surroundings: he arranged a benefit concert by Ol‚Äô Blue Eyes at the invitation of Princess Grace at the Monaco Sporting Club in 1958. By the mid-1960s, Jones was an integral part of the Rat Pack‚Äôs musical output, conducting and arranging when they performed with Count Basie in Las Vegas and beyond. They became firm friends: Sinatra called Jones Q, and Jones called Sinatra FS or Francis.As Jones says, ‚ÄúHe either loved you with all of his heart or else he'd roll over your ass in a Mack truck in reverse. He was tough, man. I saw all of it.‚Äù And ‚Äúall of it‚Äù really was inclusive. Jones recalls: ‚ÄúWe'd do one-nighters, I'd fly with him on his Learjet, he said, 'Let's get on the plane before Basie's drummer's cymbal stops ringing.‚Ä¶' Six Playboy bunnies on that.""Sinatra showed his affection for Jones by giving him a signet ring that he still wears on his little finger (he can‚Äôt take it off), which is stamped with Sinatra‚Äôs Sicilian family crest. He also made Jones excellent pasta.Famously, the female company the Rat Pack kept were as famous as they were, including Rita Hayworth. ‚ÄúFrank was always trying to hook me up with Marilyn Monroe,‚Äù Jones told GQ ‚Äúbut Marilyn Monroe had a chest that looked like pears, man.‚Äù10. He changed the face of ETJones and Steven Spielberg met in the early Eighties, when he was working on Thriller and the director was doing E.T at Laird Studio. Jones remembers ‚Äúwe met and fell in love‚Äù, and the pair - with Jackson - went on to create the film‚Äôs audiobook and soundtrack album. Spielberg gave Jones a viewfinder used by directors and Jones gave him a synthesizer, and the director also consulted Jones on the first model of E.T.It never reached the big screen because, Jones says, ‚Äúhe looked too much like a brother. That‚Äôs why the second one had blue eyes.‚Äù Jones also bonded with the other star of E.T: Drew Barrymore: ‚Äú[She] used to stay at our house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI used to hang out with her dad, John Barrymore, in Rome and Copenhagen.‚ÄùCredit: By Alice Vincent, Entertainment WriterWord count: 1910Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

It seems almost blasphemous, crudely debasing, to suggest that what Picasso did when he imaginatively remade the human face was a kind of caricature, with some of the comic energy of a cartoon. But that's what is going on in the Portrait of Gertrude Stein. The face Picasso gives Stein is not unrelated to her real one; it is a heightened graphic game of distortion. She instantly recognised the portrait as authentic.The story of its making is part of modernism's folklore. Stein sat for Picasso again and again, but in the end he set it aside, saying he couldn't get the head right. ""I can""t see you any more when I look,"" he said irritably, she remembered. Everybody went away, the Steins to Italy, he to Spain. What it was he saw there - ancient Iberian art or the desiccated faces of peasants - has been debated, but something changed.

She wrote that in 1933 when there was still some way to go in the domestication of modern art. Today, as we prepare to queue for the exhibition Matisse Picasso opening next month at Tate Modern, her words ring all too true. Everybody is accustomed to everything, and modernism is the lingua franca.Yet if anyone can make us see modern art as if for the first time, it is Stein, modernist writer, cubism's headiest chronicler, and the subject of this art movement's founding masterpiece, Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. In a sense, she is the missing third name in Matisse Picasso, because she and her art- collector brother Leo introduced Picasso to the more established Matisse.But it was Picasso who really caught Stein's imagination. They shared a raw, violent energy, a more guttural sensibility than Matisse. Gertrude and Pablo were unlikely friends: she a German- Jewish lesbian American heiress, he an Andalusian tough guy with a reputation for putting his women first on, then under, a pedestal. But they shared a truly modern sensibility.This needs to be asserted - because Stein gets a bad press. Anyone who blows their own trumpet as loudly as she did is bound to make enemies, even beyond the grave. Stein was the Oscar Wilde of the Paris modern movement - a flawed but brilliant writer, but even more, a larger-than-life personality with a flair for self- promotion. To read The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, the memoir purportedly written by her lover that made Stein a star, you would think - in fact she says outright - that she and Picasso dreamt up the modern movement between them, with Matisse hovering in the background.She exaggerated. But a lot of male memoirists and biographers went to great lengths to belittle her. Ernest Hemingway was Stein's literary protege in Paris in the 1920s - she coined the name ""Lost Generation"" for Hemingway and his contemporaries. In his memoirs, Hemingway titles his chapter on her Miss Stein Instructs, and damns her writing with faint praise.To be fair, Hemingway helped get Stein published, but he owed more than he admitted to the harsh rhythms and mythic American scope that Stein encompassed. Her writing, particularly Three Lives, published in 1909, and The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, is far more readable than caricature has it; there is a line that connects her novel The Making of Americans with Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow.In his biography of Picasso, John Richardson repeats Hemingway's charge that Stein was indisciplined as a writer. This becomes an excuse to belittle her as any kind of intellectual influence on Picasso. Stressing factual inaccuracies in The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, Richardson dismisses the fact that she was taught by the philosopher and psychologist William James, claiming she inflated James's fondness of her.Maybe - but the intellectual connection between James, Stein and modernism is real. James (himself influenced by the French philosopher Henri Bergson) argued that experience is falsely parcelled into discrete moments and objects by ""intellectualist"" philosophers, when in reality experience is continuous: one part of our life slides into another. It was James who coined the term ""stream of consciousness"" which, through Stein, became the definition of modernist writing as practised by her, as well as by James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.And there is another important modernist influence that Stein shared with Picasso: American comics. Many books have been written about the intellectual origins of Picasso's Cubism. Ancient Iberian sculptures, African masks, the philosophy of Bergson and even - although they knew nothing at the time of each other's work - Einstein's theory of relativity all help to understand the revolutionary transformation of visual experience that Picasso initiated in Paris in the years before the first world war.But as Stein relates in The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, there was another visual influence on which Picasso fed voraciously when she first knew him in Paris in 1906, when he was pushing towards the most revolutionary artistic discovery since the Renaissance: a comic strip called The Katzenjammer Kids.As Alice tells it, she and Stein were worried about Picasso and Fernande, his partner in these years, because they had broken up. So they went to see Picasso and Stein gave him a gift: a package of newspapers. ""He opened them up, they were the Sunday supplement of American papers, they were the Katzenyammer [sic] kids. Oh oui, Oh oui, he said, his face full of satisfaction, merci thanks Gertrude, and we left.""Next they went to see Fernande, who asked if Stein had any American comics left. But Picasso had got the lot of the Katzenjammer kids. ""That is a brutality that I will never forgive him,"" said Fernande.Next to the masks, next to what philosophy Picasso may have picked up, we have to consider as a visual influence that he voraciously consumed Hans and Fritz Katzenjammer, the disruptive twin sons of German immigrant Mamma Katzenjammer, who first appeared in the Sunday comic supplement of the New York Journal in 1897.It was owned by William Randolph Hearst, who hired the artist Rudolf Dirks to create a cartoon for Sundays. The Katzenjammer Kids revolutionised newspaper cartoons, using speech bubbles systematically for the first time, as well as the strip format and colour. It is still recognisably modern. Above all, it was outrageous, especially in its use of street language, mocking German immigrants - then a particularly poor community of lower east side New York.Hans and Fritz torment Mamma, her live-in sea dog companion Der Captain and the school disciplinarian Der Inspector, all of whom speak in parody German accents. ""We are playing circus - you be der clown Ma,"" say the kids. It's hard to think what Picasso made of the words, but it's easy to see why Stein was a fan. She was born to German- Jewish parents in Pennsylvania, and the cartoon reflects the German ethnicity she often emphasises in her writing, such as her story The Good Anna, about a servant ""of solid lower middle-class south German stock"" whose awkward use of English she comically relishes.And Picasso and Stein had plenty of time to discuss comics and the ideas of William James and Henri Bergson in the stream of consciousness shared by painter and sitter during the 80 or 90 sessions when he worked on her portrait in the winter of 1905-6.Picasso's Portrait of Gertrude Stein is one of his most astonishing, hypnotically disruptive works. It began as a traditional painting, almost a return to convention after the poetic symbolist experiments of Picasso's blue and rose periods. There is a massive insistence on the concentrated reality of Stein; her body is hunched over in her chair, as if caught in mid-speech, as if she were expounding.But something happens in this painting, something weird, inexplicable. Stein's face is not painted realistically like the rest of her body. It is a dry, stony, geometric mask that seems to have been fixed under her flesh, or to have magically grown out of her skull. It is a cartoonish effect, because this is not a case - as in some of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which Picasso painted the following year - of putting an African mask in place of someone's face. If anything, it is more troubling. Here the mask is flesh. It has the same colour as Stein's realistic hands and there is no disjunction between it and her neck. It is portrayed as flesh, but twisted, reconfigured. And that takes us back to the Katzenjammer Kids.When we think of Picasso and caricature, it's usually in terms of philistine jibes. ""Picasso, the painter,"" JJ Hunsecker asks his henchman Stanley in The Sweet Smell of Success, ""one 's' or two? Item: he dates three-eyed girls."" It seems almost blasphemous, crudely debasing, to suggest that what Picasso did when he imaginatively remade the human face was a kind of caricature, with some of the comic energy of a cartoon. But that's what is going on in the Portrait of Gertrude Stein. The face Picasso gives Stein is not unrelated to her real one; it is a heightened graphic game of distortion. She instantly recognised the portrait as authentic.The story of its making is part of modernism's folklore. Stein sat for Picasso again and again, but in the end he set it aside, saying he couldn't get the head right. ""I can""t see you any more when I look,"" he said irritably, she remembered. Everybody went away, the Steins to Italy, he to Spain. What it was he saw there - ancient Iberian art or the desiccated faces of peasants - has been debated, but something changed. Back in Paris, relates Stein, ""Picasso sat down and out of his head painted the head in without having seen Gertrude Stein again. And when she saw it he and she were content.""As much as anything perhaps it was the distorted, vibrant, violent, grotesque, fantastically modern graphic world of American newspaper comics that helped Picasso break out of every convention of continuity in art, that helped him paint a portrait that is a cartoon, but with gravitas. It was also, surely, a sense that subjectivity, the free flow of perception, mattered more than objective appearances; the stream of consciousness as described by James, a faith in the contingent feel of things. Picasso feels this, remembers this as Stein's face; it is the head in his head after not seeing her for a while, not the objective truth, but the truth as he experiences it.This insistence on the complicatedly personal nature of experience is totally at odds with the western pictorial tradition that begins in the Renaissance with the Florentine idea of single- point perspective.Renaissance painting and the pictorial tradition that followed sees the world as a recessive, objectively real picture, a model of the world that is a useful fiction but absolutely at odds with the flow of experience as it is insisted on by modernism. In the Portrait of Gertrude Stein, the picture breaks in two. Later in that same year of 1906, Picasso develops the caricatural mask in his own Self-Portrait, to be shown in Matisse Picasso at Tate Modern.From these two works, he develops to his sensational sexual phantasmagoria, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. These paintings inaugurate a new experience of the world, one we still find it difficult to acknowledge because we still simplify things into pictures for our convenience. The richer sense of life embodied in Picasso's art is still subversive, still has something to show us. Cubism is one thing we will never be entirely accustomed to, and that's why, for many of us, it will always be easy to choose between the two greatest artists of the 20th century.""Matisse and all the others saw . . . the reality of the 19th century,"" said Stein. ""Picasso was the one in painting who saw the twentieth century . . .""Matisse Picasso is at Tate Modern, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), from May 11 to August 18.

A man falls in love with a woman. He is an artist. She inspires him, becomes his muse. He paints her over and over again.And then the inspiration is used up. He goes seeking another. The relationship is not as important as the paintings. ‚ÄúThe man and the artist are one person in the case of Pablo Picasso,‚Äù his grandson says. ‚ÄúHe put the art first.‚ÄùIt is Wednesday morning in New York. Later today Olivier Widmaier Picasso will fly to Edinburgh for an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. Yesterday he went and sat in the Museum of Modern Art and watched the people coming to look at one of his grandfather‚Äôs most famous paintings, Les Demoiselles d‚ÄôAvignon, painted more than a century ago but still holding a huge pull for art lovers.Indeed, it is hard to think of another name in modern art that is more resonant than Picasso. Between 2017 and next year there will be 42 exhibitions mounted of his work. And that‚Äôs just in Europe. Quite frankly, Picasso is modern art.But what did that mean for those who share his surname? Those who grew up in the shadow of his legend?Widmaier Picasso, a TV producer in his day job, has written a book, Picasso An Intimate Portrait that attempts to answer those questions.In it, he talks about Picasso the artist, his political beliefs and his financialdealings. But at heart it is the story of Picasso and the women he loved and the families (plural) he created. In life as in art Picasso, his grandson suggests, was avant garde.Much of the story is tragic. There were costs to belonging to the tribe of Picasso and some struggled with the legacy.Widmaier Picasso‚Äôs grandmother Marie-Therese was one of them. She met Picasso in 1927. He was married to Olga Khokhlova at the time. Marie-Therese became Picasso‚Äôs lover and muse. They had a daughter together, Maya, Widmaier Picasso‚Äôs mother.And then Picasso met Dora Maar and soon Marie-Therese and Dora were competing for the artist‚Äôs attention.Widmaier Picasso says: ‚ÄúMarie-Therese was the sensual inspiration and Dora Maar was the intellectual stimulation.‚ÄùGrowing up, Widmaier Picasso never met his grandfather. His mother never visited because she feared being turned away at the gate of his estate. But over the years his grandson found it impossible to escape the legacy of his grandfather. It was the same for all of those children who inherited the Picasso name.‚ÄúI would say it‚Äôs not easy to live next to Picasso,‚Äù he says.‚ÄúYou are just waiting for your cheque or a word or attention. Or you live without Picasso, which is not possible because at some point someone will know that you are the grandson or the granddaughter of someone special.‚ÄúYou have 90 per cent of your life influenced by history, by his legacy, his fame, and 10% you can save as your own life.‚ÄùAnd not everyone can live with that. In the end Widmaier Picasso‚Äôs own grandmother committed suicide, as didPicasso‚Äôs second wife Jacqueline and Widmaier Picasso‚Äôs cousin, Pablito.‚ÄúFor my grandmother life after Picasso was not so exciting. She was not in need of anything. She was probably tired. The same for Jacqueline.‚ÄùHis cousin Pablito‚Äôs situation was different. He was 24 when he died, shortly after Picasso himself passed away. He drank a bottle of bleach having been turned away at the gate of Picasso‚Äôs house in Mougins.Pablito‚Äôs death was a result of a ‚Äúkind of despair,‚Äù Widmaier Picasso suggests. ‚ÄúIt has been said he was on drugs, that he was depressed,‚Äù he points out. But, really, he wonders, if the problem was the fact that his cousin shared the same name as his grandfather.‚ÄúIt was a huge mistake, a huge mistake. You cannot be Pablo Picasso after Pablo Picasso. It is impossible.‚ÄùPicasso‚Äôs life is a story of destruction as much as creation then.‚ÄúHe was not the man he should have been or the grandfather he should have been,‚Äù Widmaier Picasso acknowledges. ‚ÄúBut he had too much to do outside of the family.‚ÄúI feel a bit uncomfortable when I say ‚Äòmy grandfather.‚Äô I have to share him with the rest of the world.‚ÄùOlivier Widmaier Picasso appears at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this morning at 11am. His book Picasso An Intimate Portrait is published by Tate Publishing, priced ¬£30.CREDIT: Teddy JamiesonWord count: 745Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.
