The famous Pop Art movement came about in the US and UK in the 1950s and 60s, it took popular everyday culture and made it into art; From mass produced objects, to celebrity icons, comic book style, and cartoons.
But actually, there were the people who supported him and thought it was fantastic and they've proved to be right, because his art is still as relevant today as it was, like, 50 or 60 years ago.
Zoe, Student: I think for me, personally, it's really interesting to see the culture of the time in famous spots like Studio 54 in New York, and I think that's what young people can relate to now is being able to see that sort of street culture and atmosphere and pop culture of that time.

Eleni Coutsoudis — the niece and heir of the gallery owner — explains in the documentary Villa Iolas (2017) that it was Iolas's father, an Egyptian cotton merchant, who began building the house in the Agia Paraskevi area, northwest Athens, in 1950.
“Iolas' house was an avant-garde mecca in a Greece [that was] full of mediocrity and homophobia,” says fellow Greek artist Angelo Plessas, when talking about his own visit.
From a room dedicated to Ancient Greece, one moved to another filled with works from the Byzantine period, or to one displaying paintings by Picasso
  As a consequence of the death of Max Ernst in 1976, Iolas closed his galleries.
At the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, you can visit some works from the series that — in 1984, perhaps foreseeing how the traitors would come for him — Iolas commissioned his friend to create: the pop art version of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.

 The first-ever exhibition to focus on the legendary artist's Catholic faith at the Brooklyn Museum, “Andy Warhol: Revelation,” sits in stark contrast, almost as if displaying an entirely different artist.
 These almost inward explorations of love and faith convey a fascinating and fleshed-out portrait of Warhol as an artist and as a man caught between his Catholic faith and his queer identity.
 Warhol is still plenty tongue-in-cheek: The exhibition opens with “Raphael Madonna — $6.99,” a floor-to-ceiling painting of Madonna and child overshadowed by a bright red price tag.
Warhol, the former graphic artist, sketched advertisements for a Jesus nightlight and, in collaboration with Jean-Michel Basquiat, painted Jesus on a series of punching bags in “Ten Punching Bags (The Last Supper).”","Catholicism

Espace Louis Vuitton Seoul in Cheongdam southern Seoul is exhibiting selected works of the Andy Warhol collection from Oct to Feb next year Titled “ Andy Warhol Looking for Andy ,” the exhibition displays pieces from the high-end brand's art museum Fondation Louis Vuitton's collection in Paris Warhol's artworks being exhibiting are mostly silkscreen prints or polaroid photos from to Silkscreen printing is an industrial technique that allows artists to reproduce duplicates of the same image — a method he used when making his popular canvases of soup cans and public figures Though most of the works are depictions of Warhol himself they all vary by personifying his versatile characteristics While some barely even show his face others portray his face from various angles Some even feature Warhol dressed as a drag queen “ Self-Portrait )” is one of the three series of self-portraits Warhol drew in the 1960s all based on the same photo of himself It shows half of Warhol's face with his hand touching his mouth expressing a “ confident poised and even restrained attitude ” of the artist as described by the Fondation Louis Vuitton In “ Self-Portrait ),” Warhol reveals three different angles of his face using a snapshot technique which he turned into a polyptych .
A polyptych is a painting that is divided into numerous sections Also on display is Warhol's “ The Shadow ),” a self-portrait showing the left-side of his face and a shadow being cast For his silkscreen portraits Warhol tended to illustrate his own face in a vague and obscure manner However in some polaroid photos taken between and he staged himself creatively — with sunglasses wigs and makeup The interesting thing about Warhol's polaroids is that they address both masculinity and femininity Twelve polaroid photos show Warhol wearing his signature “ fright wig ,” and posing in many ways He collaborated with the American photographer Christopher Makos in his drag queen photos In some he even combined the two concepts wearing makeup and a wig and a dress shirt and a tie at the same time Warhol was known for his fascination of drag queens He recruited drag queens in the nightclubs of New York subsequently printing out paintings of them One of his key pieces “ Ladies and Gentlemen )” of transgender actor Wilhelmina Ross can be seen at the Louis Vuitton exhibition Yet probably the most eye-catching artwork of them all , “ Self-Portrait )” clearly shows Warhol's face bringing viewers eye-to-eye with the artist This piece captures a front view of the artist's face once again wearing his silver tousled wig One may wonder what Warhol was thinking when he took this photo with his blank stare seemingly penetrating through the canvas The Fondation describes it as “[ conveying ] a mixture of despair and anguish .”
This interpretation can be considered more plausible as the painting was created in just a year before Warhol's death Espace Louis Vuitton Seoul is open every day from a.m. to p.m. except on New Year's Day and the Lunar New Year holidays The exhibition is free .

“It's one of the most exciting stories in the history of art: how it started, how intense it was, how it ended,” summarizes Dieter Buchhart, the curator of the Basquiat and Warhol exhibition, Painting with Four Hands , which can be seen until August 28 at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris.
  
The numbers of the exhibition – held in the Frank Gehry building in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris – are overwhelming: 11 galleries, 4 floors, 80 joint canvases, plus works by other artists of the time, along with the iconic photographs by Michael Halsband, which show Basquiat and Warhol dressed as boxers.
In the Louis Vuitton catalogue, Bischofberger writes: “Basquiat – who had hoped to gain notoriety thanks to this exhibition and consecration thanks to the famous Warhol – was disappointed by the critical reaction and practically decided to end the painting sessions at The Factory.”
His admirers are like a posse of right-to-lifers, adoring the fetus of a talent and rhapsodizing about what a great man it might have become if only it had lived.”

 Known for his silkscreen paintings, especially the one with a copyright dispute between Warhol and photographer Lynn Goldsmith, who claims Warhol violated copyright when he used a photo she took of the deceased singer Prince as the basis for a series of prints, the pop artist has sketched many notable works portraying Queen Elizabeth, former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis, actress Elizabeth Taylor and artist Jean-Michele Basquiat.
 Warhol played a vital role in the visual art movement known as pop art that originated in the 1960s in the UK and USA, his work became larger than life because of his portrayal of celebrities and consumerism.
 “Warhol's pop art, though located in mid-century USA, is timeless and universal.

  Digitally remastered silent films by Andy Warhol of visitors to The Factory, as his New York studio was known, will be exhibited later this month at Christie's Los Angeles galleries in a curated exhibition done in collaboration with the Andy Warhol Museum.
  
Bell said to him, “‘I don't think enough people know about these films in the L.A. collecting community, and we should really think of an event to showcase them and build support for them.”
  That support is needed for the museum's “Film Initiative,” a project to preserve Warhol's moving-camera legacy by digitally transferring originals housed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where Warhol initially left them.
The eight films to be shown are silent, moving portraits that include some of the more well-known actors, celebrities, and musicians that came through Warhol's studio in the mid-1960s.","Arts & Entertainment

The justices heard arguments in the Andy Warhol Foundation's appeal of a lower court's ruling that his 1984 paintings - based on a 1981 photo of Prince that celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith shot for Newsweek magazine in 1981 - were not protected by a copyright law doctrine called fair use.
Some justices expressed skepticism of a lower court's ruling that judges should not consider the meaning of an artistic work in determining fair use, but also wondered whether Warhol's work was transformative.


A federal judge found Warhol's works were protected by the fair use doctrine, having transformed the ""vulnerable"" musician depicted in Goldsmith's work into an ""iconic, larger-than-life figure.
""

In reversing that ruling last year, the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said judges should not ""assume the role of art critic and seek to ascertain the intent behind or meaning of the works"" but instead should decide whether the new work has a ""fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character"" that ""stands apart from the 'raw material' used to create it.","Copyright Infringement

Andy Warhol's iconic Marilyn Monroe portrait sells for record $195 million  In May, Warhol's 1964 portrait of actress Marilyn Monroe sold for US$195 million at a Christie's auction in New York, making it the most expensive American artwork sold at auction and the second-most expensive auctioned piece of art, trailing only Leonardo da Vinci's “Salvator Mundi,” which sold for $450 million in 2017 at Christie's  “It's hard to believe the portrait of Marilyn Monroe, painted in his studio where I often visited, became the most paid-for American painting,” Warhola says.
A selection of Andy Warhol's earliest paintings that have been kept in his family for more than 70 years will hit the auction block later this year, according to a Warhol nephew, artist James Warhola.
 Warhol (born Andrew Warhola Jr. ) left Pittsburgh for New York in 1949 and worked as a commercial artist for nearly a decade.
 Warhol once entered “Nosepicker 1,” a self-portrait, in a local art show, but it was rejected by two of the three judges because they thought it was offensive, according to Warhola.","Fine Art

Warhol, who was a gay, adapted — and, oftentimes, subverted — religious themes in his artwork, the exhibit argues, in part by questioning traditional depictions of women and mothers and by using male bodies as a way to explore queer desire.
And through his portraits of celebrities and paintings of objects that shaped American consumerist culture in the 1960s — including Campbell’s soup cans and Coke bottles — Warhol “very presciently tapped into kind of an undercurrent of society that you could call worship,” said Carmen Hermo, associate curator at the Brooklyn Museum’s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, who organized the exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum with José Carlos Diaz, chief curator at the Andy Warhol Museum.
A new exhibit on view at the Brooklyn Museum, “Andy Warhol: Revelation,” aims to correct this historical oversight, by featuring more than 100 objects that show how Warhol’s relationship to religion served as both a muse and a methodology for his art, and a guiding force in his personal life.
At Andy Warhol's memorial service on April 1, 1987, many mourners learned a lesser-known aspect of his life: Warhol was raised as a Byzantine Catholic and remained so throughout his life, the art historian John Richardson said in his eulogy at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York.
Warhol’s mother, Julia Zavacky Warhola, a Slovakian immigrant, cultivated her son's religious roots during his childhood in Pittsburgh in the 1930s, when she brought him to four church services every weekend, “Revelation” notes.","Catholicism

Sixty years ago today, the pop artist Andy Warhol unveiled a wall of 32 Campbell Soup can paintings at a Los Angeles gallery, one for each flavor of soup then in production.
Meanwhile, Warhol proved very brand loyal -- he did not stray to Lipton, although he did do some Coca-Cola bottle art -- and Campbell soup cans and boxes made regular appearances in his productions and in his interviews and MTV show of the 1980s.
According to a letter in its archives, a product marketing manager wrote to Warhol: ""Your work has evoked a great deal of interest here at Campbell soup company.
Today, the company has a soup can painting hanging in its Camden, New Jersey, headquarters, said Jolly, and continues to work with the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in charitable ventures and most recently on licensed hoodies and other apparel.","Fine Art

For reference, the estimate for that work's going price was $100 million - half that of 'Shot Sage Blue Marilyn,' meaning the Warhol print could end up eclipsing it.


Before its recent move to the auction block, 'Shot Sage-Blue Marilyn' has been exhibited in galleries worldwide, including Leon Kraushar in New York, which also held Warhol's pop-art portraits of Jackie Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor; the Guggenheim Museum; the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris; Tate Modern in London; Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid; the Royal Academy of Arts in London; the Museum Ludwig in Cologne; the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin; and the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, among others.


Hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin paid the estate of Si Newhouse at least $200 million for the orange version of the 'Shot Marilyn' series, according to The Wall Street Journal - in total, there are ten versions of the print, all in different colors, such as sage blue, blue, orange, red and turquoise.","Fine Art

Pop artist Andy Warhol's famed 1964 silk-screen portrait of Marilyn Monroe sold for $195 million on Monday, a record for a work by an American artist put on sale at auction.

""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" is one in a series of portraits Warhol made of the actress following her death in 1962 and has since become one of pop art's best-known pieces.

""'Shot Sage Blue Marilyn' is the absolute pinnacle of American Pop,"" Alex Rotter, chairman of 20th and 21st Century art at Christie's, said in a statement announcing the auction.
Its title refers to an incident in which a woman shot at a stack of four Marilyn portraits in Warhol's studio with a pistol, although ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" was not struck by a bullet.
The sale broke the previous record for an American artwork at auction of $110.5 million set in 2017 for a 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat.","Fine Art

The justices were considering the Andy Warhol Foundation's appeal of a lower court's ruling that his 1984 paintings - based on a 1981 photo of Prince that celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith shot for Newsweek magazine in 1981 - were not protected by a copyright law doctrine called fair use.
A federal judge found Warhol's works were protected by the fair use doctrine, having transformed the ""vulnerable"" musician depicted in Goldsmith's work into an ""iconic, larger-than-life figure.
She countersued Warhol's estate for copyright infringement in 2017 after it asked a Manhattan federal court to rule that his works did not violate her rights.


Goldsmith, 74, has said she learned of Warhol's unlicensed works only after Prince's 2016 death.","Copyright Infringement

The auction house will offer the set, known as Warhol Campbell’s Soup I, as a highlight of its evening auction on Monday in London, with a presale estimate of between £600,000 (US$847,100) and £900,000.
Between 1961-62, Warhol painted 32 Campbell’s Soup cans, one for each flavor the company offered at that time.
The complete set debuted on July 9, 1962, in Warhol's first solo gallery exhibition in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles, curated by gallery owner Irving Blum.
From then on, the colorful Campbell’s Soup cans became one of the most recognizable images by the leading figure of the Pop Art movement in the U.S.

Additional highlights of Phillips London sales of 20th-century and contemporary art include three Banksy’s screenprints in colors: Rat Love, 2004; Bomb Love (Bomb Hugger), 2003; and Laugh Now, each with an estimate of between £70,000 and £90,000.","Fine Art

Signed by both men, the portrait is billed by the auction house as a work that brings together two of the most recognizable names of the 20th century and captures “a trajectory of celebrity and tragedy.”

“Warhol certainly could never have imagined how differently the image would come to be viewed, nor the controversy that still lingers around its subject today,” said Robert Manley, co-head of 20th century and contemporary art at the Phillips auction house, which is auctioning the work May 16.

In 2016, Vanity Fair published a Prince tribute which featured Warhol's image but no credit or payment was given to the photographer, Lynn Goldsmith.
  
The parent company, Condé Nast, did not pay or credit Goldsmith at the time but the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts was paid about $10,000 (£8,056) for the new image.

Lisbon, Sept 22 (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 22nd Sep, 2021 ) :US filmmaker, writer, painter, photographer and musician, Gus Van Sant, is now turning his hand to theatre with a new musical in Lisbon about the early career of Pop Art creator, Andy Warhol.
Van Sant -- best-known for films such as ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" -- said he had long wanted to make a film about Warhol, and even wrote a screenplay with US actor River Phoenix, who died at 23 in 1993, set for the lead role.
Now, in his first-ever work for the stage, the 69-year-old laureate of Canne's Palme d'Or has written the musical ""Andy"", which is being premiered on Thursday in the Portuguese capital as part of the Biennial of Contemporary Arts where Van Sant is one of this year's artists in residence.
With dialogue and songs penned by Van Sant himself, the musical -- which is being staged in English in Lisbon's prestigious Teatro Nacional D. Maria II, ahead of a European tour that takes it to cities such as Rome, Amsterdam, Paris and Athens -- is a collection of anecdotes about Warhol's encounters with leading figures of American culture, like writer Truman Capote, art critic Clement Greenberg and actor Edie Sedgwick.
Among Van Sant's films are biopics about iconic figures such as Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain in ""Last Days"" and gay rights campaigner Harvey Milk in ""Milk"".","Fine Art

An iconic 1964 silk-screen portrait of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol sold for a little more than $195 million in New York on Monday night, the highest price ever paid for an American artwork at auction.


Accounts of the Podber episode vary — some say it was a misunderstanding over the words “to shoot,” which Warhol apparently understood to be a request by Podber to photograph his work; others have described the word play as deliberate, Christie’s said in a pre-auction write-up of the work.
The Warhol portrait, described by Christie’s art expert Alex Rotter as “one of the greatest paintings of all time,” sold in about four minutes of bidding to dealer Larry Gagosian.


Monday night’s sale marked the start of New York’s spring auction season, which is returning to life after a two-year lull caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
According to Christie’s, the news of Monroe’s death on Aug. 5, 1962, “struck a personal chord for Warhol,” who began featuring her in his work shortly after, using a cropped publicity photo from the film “Niagara.”","Fine Art

Referring to Warhol’s devout Catholicism, Sotheby’s said: “There is no doubt that the physical magnitude of the panel – the largest of all Warhol’s single-panel car crash works – has the power to invoke a sense of awe and reverence akin to that of a religious altarpiece.
Warhol began silkscreening images of car accidents, plane crashes and other catastrophes in the early 1960s, using photographs from newspapers and police archives as source material.


In fact, the religious overtones of the work extend beyond its mere scale.”

It quoted the art historian John Richardson as saying: “The whole repetition of Andy’s imagery stems from the fact that he was Catholic.
It is part of Warhol’s 1960s Death and Disaster series that reflected the artist’s preoccupation with mortality.","Automotive

© Reuters.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday began hearing arguments in a copyright dispute between a photographer and Andy Warhol's estate over the famed artist's paintings of rock star Prince in a case that could help set boundaries for artistic works that draw upon other material.
 
The justices were considering the Andy Warhol Foundation's appeal of a lower court's ruling that his 1984 paintings - based on a 1981 photo of Prince that celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith shot for Newsweek magazine in 1981 - were not protected by a copyright law doctrine called fair use.
A federal judge found Warhol's works were protected by the fair use doctrine, having transformed the ""vulnerable"" musician depicted in Goldsmith's work into an ""iconic, larger-than-life figure.
She countersued Warhol's estate for copyright infringement in 2017 after it asked a Manhattan federal court to rule that his works did not violate her rights.","Copyright Infringement

“So why shouldn’t we ask,” Kagan added, if a work is really creative and “something new and entirely different?”

Kagan noted that a 2021 Supreme Court ruling on fair use of software cited Warhol as an “example of how somebody can take an original work and make it be something entirely different, and that’s exactly what the fair use doctrine wants to protect.”

Warhol, who died in 1987, was a central figure in the pop art movement that arose in the 1950s.
A judge found Warhol’s works were protected by fair use, having transformed the “vulnerable” musician seen in Goldsmith’s work into an “iconic, larger-than-life figure.”

The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last year.


In lively arguments that touched on the meaning of art and referenced famous films, TV shows and paintings, U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday grappled with a copyright dispute between a photographer and Andy Warhol’s estate over the acclaimed artist’s paintings of rock star Prince.

Van Sant, best known for films such as “My Own Private Idaho” and “Good Will Hunting,” said he had long wanted to make a film about Warhol, and even wrote a screenplay with actor River Phoenix, who died at 23 in 1993, set for the lead role.
Now, in his first ever work for the stage, the 69-year-old laureate of Canne’s Palme d’Or has written the musical “Andy,” which is being premiered on Thursday in the Portuguese capital as part of the Biennial of Contemporary Arts where Van Sant is one of this year’s artists in residence.
With dialogue and songs penned by Van Sant himself, the musical — which is being staged in English in Lisbon’s prestigious Teatro Nacional D. Maria II, ahead of a European tour that takes it to cities such as Rome, Amsterdam, Paris and Athens — is a collection of anecdotes about Warhol’s encounters with leading figures of American culture, like writer Truman Capote, art critic Clement Greenberg and actor Edie Sedgwick.
For Van Sant’s collaborator on the project, John Romao, Warhol was “someone half-hidden in the shadows, shy, but very forceful at the same time, thanks to his ability to turn his ideas into reality.","Fine Art

""What distinguishes (the painting) is not only its immense scale, which really bewilders anybody who stands in front of it ... but also its palette,"" explained David Galperin, Sotheby's head of contemporary art in New York, adding that Warhol repeated his image in the series in different tonalities, including lavender and orange.
It reigned as Warhol's most expensive artwork until last year, when a 40-inch silkscreen of Monroe shattered the record for any American artist, reaching $195 million.

Leading up to the sale, ""White Disaster"" will exhibit at Sotheby's New York from November 4-16.
Warhol worked on the ""Death and Disaster"" series at the same time that he was screenprinting his famed images of Monroe after her death in 1962.


""These ideas of celebrity, tragedy, fame, death — these are the themes that occupied Warhol and I think that the series he was working on simultaneously, the Marilyn paintings and the ""Death and Disaster paintings, are intricately linked,"" Galperin said.

 “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” has been displayed in museums around the globe, including the New York City’s Guggenheim Museum, London’s Tate Modern, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and is just one of dozens of images that Warhol created of Monroe, according to CNN.

“It is important to see his progression with textile design as something that directly helped inform his early pop art, both in subject matter and approach.”

Rayner and Chamberlain have now curated a new exhibition with London’s Fashion and Textile Museum which, by placing more than 60 of their most significant Warhol textiles on display – many for the very-first time – explores this lesser-known, though clearly meaningful, part of the artist’s career.

While it seems impossible that a painting by Andy Warhol would ever be delivered by post – or transported anywhere without considerable fanfare – the influential pop artist’s textile designs have not commanded the same level of reverence.
Through these years of dedicated research, out the years, Raynor and Chamberlain collected textiles that speak clearly to Warhol’s love of repeat patterns and innate ability to elevate the everyday.

Warhol's foundation asserted that the Prince silkscreen fell under the fair use doctrine, which permits reproduction of copyrighted material without permission in some circumstances, such as for criticism.
But the rock 'n' roll photographer who filed the lawsuit, Lynn Goldsmith, countered that such a standard would make copyright ""completely unworkable,"" in part because it would ask judges to assess the meaning of a derivative artwork and whether it is transformative enough not to be an infringement of the earlier work.


Putting the two images of Prince side by side, the appeals court ruled Warhol's piece wasn't transformative because it ""recognizably"" derived from and retained ""the essential elements"" of Goldsmith's photograph.","Copyright Infringement

The court found that Warhol's silkscreen wasn't fair use because the two works of art were both commissioned for magazine articles about Prince.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the Court's opinion that the purpose is the important question, and in this case, the use of both works is “of a commercial nature.”
It could have gone another way; the Warhol Foundation argued the purposes of the two works were different because they sent a different message, namely that Warhol's portrait made an artistic comment on capitalism and celebrity, while the original photo was just a photo that showed what Prince looked like.
  
You don't have to pay the original artist if it's fair use, which is determined based on four factors : the purpose you're using it for, the nature of the art, how substantially you used the original work, and how your new art affects the market for the original.","Copyright Infringement

In her opinion, Sotomayor wrote that the licensed Warhol work and Goldsmith’s photograph were not “sufficiently distinct” from each other for fair use to apply.


“AWF has offered no other persuasive justification for its unauthorized use of the photograph.”

Sotomayor, who included examples of Warhol’s famous works throughout her opinion, also noted that People magazine had paid Goldsmith $1,000 to use one of her photographs in its own Prince tribute issue.


In a 7-2 decision, the high court found the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWF) improperly licensed a work from the pop art icon’s series based on a photograph by Lynn Goldsmith for the cover of a commemorative magazine after the “Darling Nikki” singer died in 2016.


“Goldsmith’s photograph of Prince, and AWF’s copying use of the photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine devoted to Prince, share substantially the same commercial purpose,” she wrote.","Copyright Infringement

The high-profile case, which pits an artist's freedom to riff on existing works of art against the protection of an artist from copyright infringement, hinges on whether Warhol's images of Prince transform Goldsmith's photograph to a great enough degree to stave off claims of copyright infringement and therefore be considered as ""fair use.""

Goldsmith did license the use of her Prince photo to Vanity Fair back in 1984, when the magazine commissioned Warhol to create a silkscreen work based on Goldsmith's photo and then used an image of Warhol's piece to accompany an article they ran that year about the musician.","Copyright Infringement

Featuring more than 250 works drawn from almost 30 different lenders, the exhibition ranges from the bright silk-screen serial portraits for which Warhol is best known (including a set of 10 Marilyn Monroes) to his famous 'screen tests' (featuring Lou Reed and Salvador Dali, among others), one-off polaroids and photo booth portraits, and lush gelatin silver photographs he took of friends, collaborators and the New York scene.

Crucially, the exhibition puts Warhol's work in the context of a thriving scene of photographers he counted as influences and collaborators, particularly during the heyday of the Silver Factory (as his studio from 1964-68 was called).
In a surprisingly tender moment, in the show's final stretch, Christopher Makos's 1981 portrait series Altered Image: Five Photographs of Andy Warhol shows the artist role-playing an idealised self, with perfect make-up and a platinum-blonde wig.

A relevant Supreme Court precedent cited by both sides is a 1994 ruling in which the court held that it was fair use when rap group 2 Live Crew created a song called “Pretty Woman” that was a parody of Roy Orbison’s “Oh, Pretty Woman.”

Like the parody song, Warhol’s additions created something new that conveyed a different message, the foundation’s lawyers argue.


The following year the issue ended up in court, with Goldsmith and the foundation suing each other to determine whether Warhol’s image constituted fair use.


But Goldsmith said she was not aware that Warhol had created other images that were not licensed, a fact she only became aware of after Vanity Fair publisher Conde Nast used a different image as part of a 2016 Prince tribute immediately after the rock star's death.


Goldsmith’s lawyers point to other language in the 2 Live Crew ruling that said a fair use argument is undermined if there is a risk that the new work will supersede the original and undercut its market value.","Copyright Infringement

In White Disaster, Warhol duplicated a single image of an automobile accident 19 times in black and white.

Bouaziz told the customer that the pieces, which he was selling for between $75,000 and $240,000, were authentic originals and that some were signed by the artists themselves, investigators said.


“Bouaziz won people over with his philanthropy, high-end vehicles, ties to the local synagogue, invitations to lunch, history as an opera singer, art events, and more.”
Officials said the customer gave Bouaziz a $200,000 down payment that was deposited into Bouaziz’s account, and then the comingled funds were wired to other accounts.

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the late Andy Warhol infringed on a photographer’s copyright when he created a series of silk screens based on a photograph of the late singer Prince.


The opinion has been closely anticipated by the global art world watching to see how the court would balance an artist’s freedom to borrow from existing works and the restrictions of copyright law.


The court rejected arguments made by a lawyer of the Andy Warhol Foundation (the artist died in 1987) that his work was sufficiently transformative so as not to trigger copyright concerns.


“Goldsmith’s original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists.
It will make our world poorer.”

Central to the case was whether Warhol infringed on Goldsmith’s copyright when he created a series of silk screens of the musician Prince.

Lawyers for the Warhol Foundation asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, arguing that a lower court decision that went against the artist “threatens a sea change” in the law of copyright.

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the late Andy Warhol infringed on a photographer’s copyright when he created a series of silk screens based on a photograph of the late singer Prince.


Kagan said she hoped the public would read her dissent carefully: “I’ll take my chances on readers’ good judgment.”

“Fair Use protects the First Amendment rights of both speakers and listeners by ensuring that those whose speech involves dialogue with preexisting copyrighted works are not prevented from sharing that speech with the world,” a group of art law professors who supported the Andy Warhol Foundation told the justices in court papers.


Kagan said that Warhol’s “eye-popping” silk screen of Prince “dramatically” altered Goldsmith’s photograph and she called Warhol the “avatar of transformative copying.”

“There is precious little evidence in today’s opinion,” she lamented, “that the majority has actually looked at these images, much less that it has engaged with expert views of their aesthetics and meaning.”


“Goldsmith’s original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the majority opinion, referring to Lynn Goldsmith, the photographer at the center of the case.

 close
  Rock ‘n' roll portrait photographer Lynn Goldsmith won her case at the Supreme Court on Thursday against the Andy Warhol Foundation, and she called it a victory for artists and photographers who make their living by licensing art.
  
The question before the Supreme Court was whether the ""fair use"" doctrine of the Copyright Act protected artist Andy Warhol, who used the images of Prince captured by Goldsmith to create new works of art without her credit or consent.
  
""In this case, however, Goldsmith's original photograph of Prince, and AWF's [Andy Warhol Foundation] copying use of that photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine devoted to Prince, share substantially the same purpose, and the use is of a commercial nature,"" she said.
  
The Supreme Court's decision in AWF v. Goldsmith is a tremendous win for these artists and the creative community as a whole,"" she said.
  
""
  When Prince's ""star exploded"" with the release of his Purple Rain album three years later, Vanity Fair commissioned Andy Warhol to recreate – with permission and licensing fees – one of the photographs from Goldsmith's 1981 shoot.","Copyright Infringement

""AdvertisementThe sale, which accepted payment in the cryptocurrency Ether, marks a historical milestone for both Revolver Gallery and the Warhol Foundation, which hasn't released any works since 1987 when Andy Warhol passed—until now, when the Foundation minted five NFTs of Warhol's original digital art to be auctioned off at Christie's between May 19th and 27th.
The works became lost to an obsolete floppy disk, but were recovered in 2014 by Cory Arcangel, along with members of the Carnegie Mellon computer club and the Andy Warhol Foundation.Interestingly, the restoration of the digital works has led many to consider Warhol as the first ever commercial artist to experiment with digital art.

Echoing a recommendation from president Joe Biden’s administration, the supreme court focused on the specific use that allegedly infringed Goldsmith’s copyright – a license of Warhol’s work to Conde Nast – and said it was not transformative because it served the same commercial purpose as Goldsmith’s photo: to depict Prince in a magazine.


The justices, in a 7-2 ruling authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, upheld a lower court’s ruling that Warhol’s works based on Goldsmith’s 1981 photo were not immune from her copyright infringement lawsuit.


A key factor courts have used to determine fair use is whether the new work has a “transformative” purpose such as parody, education or criticism.


Warhol created 14 silkscreens and two pencil illustrations based on the photo Goldsmith had taken of Prince for Newsweek magazine in 1981, most of which were not authorized by the photographer.

The Warhol Foundation said the art at issue, a 1984 Prince silkscreen of a photo taken by Goldsmith three years earlier, was protected by the fair use doctrine because it was transformative and had fundamentally changed the meaning conveyed by the original image.
  
In a decision that could cause a major impact on artistic expression, the Supreme Court today (May 18) ruled against
the Andy Warhol Foundation in a suit involving a copyright violation via the late artist's appropriation of an image of Prince by photographer Lynn Goldsmith.
  
After the Warhol image was used again by Vanity Fair parent company Conde Nast following Prince's 2016 death, Goldsmith sued under the grounds that this standard renders copyright law “completely unworkable,” and that it would be up to a judge's discretion to parse the intent and meaning of art vis-a-vis its transformative aspects and possible infringement.
  
“This decision enhances our ability to protect songwriters from increasingly broad claims from would-be infringers of fair use, strengthening creators' rights to determine how their art is exploited and valued.”

It was created while Simpson, 75, was the star running back of the Buffalo Bills and will go on auction at Phillips in New York City on May 16


Manley noted that five decades after Warhol made it, the portrait still evokes a strong reaction.

'Those who view the image of Simpson staring directly down the camera are likely to recall the other notorious picture of the celebrity — his mugshot,' he said.

'Juxtaposing these two images, created at such different points in Simpson's life, shows a fascinating trajectory of celebrity and tragedy.'

A previous image of OJ Simpson sold for $687,000 at a Christie's auction house in 2019.

 Monday's sale is significant for yet another reason: “Every time one of these 40-inch Marilyn paintings comes to market,"" Flaum said, ""it resets the market for Warhol, but also the entire contemporary art market.

FORT PIERCE, Fla. --
A South Florida art dealer pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday in connection with a scheme involving the sale of fake Andy Warhol paintings.


Prosecutors said Bouaziz, the owner of Danieli Fine Art and Galerie Danieli in Palm Beach County, sold counterfeit artwork to a customer in October 2021 including pieces purportedly by Warhol.


Daniel Elie Bouaziz, 69, pleaded to a single count of money laundering in Fort Pierce federal court, while prosecutors agreed to drop 16 other counts related to fraud and embezzlement, according to court records.
Bouaziz told the customer that the pieces, which he was selling for between $75,000 and $240,000, were authentic originals and that some were signed by the artist, investigators said.

The painting, the star lot at Sotheby’s contemporary art evening sale on Nov. 16 in New York, will be the third work from the Warhol series featuring repeated images of a car crash to appear at auction in the last 15 years.
White Disaster, which depicts the same image as Silver Car Crash and Orange Car Crash Fourteen Times (now in the Museum of Modern Art, or MoMA, in New York), was originally owned by the former Stable Gallery in New York, where the artist had his first solo exhibition in November 1962.
White Disaster (White Car Crash 19 Times), 1963, 12-feet tall and six-feet wide, depicts a repeated image of a deadly car crash taken from a newspaper across seven rows in black-and-white.
“The repetition of images, the desensitization of mass media, the spectacle of death, the tragedy of fame—everything is wrapped up in this painting and it presents in this monumental gripping scale that is really kind of bewildering,” says David Galperin, head of contemporary art for the Americas at Sotheby’s.

""There can be no doubt that this sale will captivate top collectors from around the world and that it will make history as a defining moment in the art market,” said Charles Stewart, Sotheby's chief executive officer, at a livestreamed press conference on Thursday.
The announcement is a welcome piece of revitalizing news for the international art market as it rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove down sales and caused layoffs at galleries and dealerships.
Real estate mogul Harry Macklowe and his wife Linda acquired the pieces over the course of their decades-long marriage, but a New York judge ordered them to sell the collection and split the proceeds during their 2018 divorce trial.
Sotheby's said on Thursday it would offer the Macklowe Collection at two sales in New York, one on Nov. 15 and the second in May 2022.","Apartments

A group called Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies posted video to social media showing two women applying blue graffiti to five of 10 screen prints by Warhol depicting Campbell’s soup cans and then gluing themselves to the work at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra.

While Makos' career bloomed with access to the talent and celebrities surrounding his friend, Warhol also benefited greatly from their relationship.


That's because his subject is the United States of America, Makos declares: Warhol is still relevant because he never looked to Europe for his ideas.

Sometimes a creative artist needs to find the right place to apply their talent and, in Lancaster, Andy found that community.

 The collision between the Pop art icon and the young enfant terrible led to a few shows, including one at the Tony Shafrazi gallery in New York, accompanied by publicity shots of Warhol and Basquiat in boxing gloves.
The playwright Anthony McCarten, Oscar-nominated writer of the Two Popes , has had a stab at imagining it in The Collaboration, a play which opens at the Young Vic this week, directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah and starring Paul Bettany as Warhol and Jeremy Pope as Basquiat.
Jennifer Stein, an early collaborator, says that the Pop artist was the young Haitian-Puerto Rican's “great hero”, and Basquiat treasured Warhol's 1975 book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again).
 Warhol and Basquiat knew each other long before their collaboration (which, though the play doesn't tell us this, began as a three-way endeavour, with the Italian painter Francesco Clemente, who dropped out after their first exhibition).","Fine Art

 It was unclear Wednesday where the Supreme Court might end up on the question of whether Andy Warhol ripped off famed photographer Lynn Goldsmith's portrait of the late musician Prince, but it was an entertaining nearly two hours of discovery  Justice Clarence Thomas disclosed that he was a Prince fan back in the '80s, and after prompting from Justice Elena Kagan, occasionally now.
At another point, Blatt, a veteran Supreme Court advocate known for her colloquial style, disputed Martinez's contention that the appeals court judges had not adequately evaluated whether Warhol's work added new meaning to Goldsmith's work.  
“Both courts below agreed, and Goldsmith doesn't dispute, that Warhol's Prince Series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different meaning or message from Goldsmith's photograph,” Martinez said.
Of course, there were also Campbell soup cans  Supreme Court, dogged by questions of legitimacy, is ready to resume  The justices were considering whether Warhol, who died in 1987, violated copyright law by basing his 16 silk-screen portraits of Prince on a photo of the musician by Goldsmith without her permission, credit or payment.
“The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis.”  From the archives: Warhol's fading fortunes  Lisa S. Blatt, representing Goldsmith, said that if the Warhol Foundation prevails, “copyrights will be at the mercy of copycats.”  ","Fine Art

Warhol Creative’s new work space will be provided at a preferential rent, Moore said, by Jeremy Leventhal, a museum advisory board member and developer from New York who owns the empty building and whose company has invested in several other commercial and residential properties in Pittsburgh, including a North Side complex of more than one million square feet called Nova Place, which is a couple of blocks from the Warhol.
Several dozen young people ranging in age from their teens to their twenties who have been working as employees and paid interns for an in-house, museum-run group called Warhol Creative are scheduled to move into the seventh floor of an empty office building next to the museum.
Moore said that the collective Warhol Creative work space is meant to capture part of the spirit of the Factory, in Manhattan, where Warhol mass-produced images, made films and engaged in what often felt like a lifelong piece of performance art with cameos by people like Lou Reed, Billy Name, Halston, Candy Darling and Baby Jane Holzer.

“When something like a pandemic comes along, it doubles down on the idea that this is a pretty volatile business model,” Moore said, adding, “The museum was set up with a treasure trove of art but without an endowment.”","Apartments

WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) -
The justices upheld a lower court's ruling that Warhol's works based on Goldsmith's 1981 photo were not immune from her copyright infringement lawsuit.


Andy Warhol's estate lost its U.S. Supreme Court copyright fight with celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith on Thursday as the justices faulted the famed pop artist's use of her photo of singer Prince in a silkscreen series depicting the charismatic rock star.


The case has been watched closely in the art world and entertainment industry for its implications regarding the legal doctrine called fair use, which promotes freedom of expression by allowing the use of copyright-protected works under certain circumstances without the owner's permission.

Ukraine's national anti-corruption agency is zeroing in on one of the most colorful — and poorly regulated — places where sanctioned Russians can move cash: the art market.


""Russian oligarchs, despite the sanctions imposed on them, can still easily hide and launder their money through art objects,"" the agency wrote on its newly-launched page.
The nature of the art market offers many loopholes for the transfer of assets, the site says.


The National Agency on Corruption Prevention has launched a database that tracks $1.3 billion worth of art it says was recently bought or sold by sanctioned Russian oligarchs, including a Monet lily pond painting, a Da Vinci depiction of Christ, and a Picasso portrait.

The justices took up the Andy Warhol Foundation's appeal of a lower court ruling that his paintings - based on a photo of Prince that photographer Lynn Goldsmith had shot for Newsweek magazine in 1981 - were not protected by the copyright law doctrine called fair use.
In a case that could help clarify when and how artists can make use of the work of others, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide a copyright dispute between a photographer and Andy Warhol's estate over Warhol's 1984 paintings of rock star Prince.


After Goldsmith challenged that decision, the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year found that Warhol's paintings had not made fair use of the photo, allowing Goldsmith's case to proceed.
Goldsmith, who has said she did not learn about the unlicensed works until after Prince died in 2016, asked the court to block Warhol's estate from making further use of her work and for an unspecified amount of money damages.","Copyright Infringement

 Andy Warhol's estate has lost its US Supreme Court copyright fight with celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith as the justices faulted the pop artist's use of her photo of singer Prince in a silkscreen series depicting the rock star.
  
The justices, in a 7-2 ruling authored by progressive Justice Sonia Sotomayor, upheld a lower court's ruling that Warhol's works based on Goldsmith's 1981 photo were not immune from her copyright infringement lawsuit.
  
Warhol created 14 silkscreens and two pencil illustrations based on the photo that Goldsmith had taken of Prince for Newsweek magazine in 1981, most of which were not authorised by the photographer.
  
She countersued the Andy Warhol Foundation in 2017 after it asked a court to find that the works did not violate her copyright.
  
Vanity Fair magazine had commissioned Warhol to make an image of Prince to be published accompanying a story about the rocker, giving credit to Goldsmith for the source photograph.

The analysis also considers sales value, liquidity, average prices, bidder confidence, and market momentum for each artist, and draws on Sotheby's internal data on bidders and private sales.
  
“The data in the report shows that our collectors, even the youngest ones, are interested in the entire span of history,” Brooke Lampley, Sotheby's head of global fine art, said during the roundtable.
“We all know that the art market has never been as transparent as the financial markets, so any information we can give our clients in terms of trends, analysis, and insight will allow them to make more thoughtful and educated decisions about their purchases, whether they see them as an investment or are pursuing a passion,” Mari-Claudia Jiménez, Sotheby's head of global business development, said during a roundtable discussion with her colleagues and ArtTactic CEO Anders Petterson that's included in the report.

Guide: A look at the key cases pending before the Supreme Court

The case concerns a 1981 photo by Lynn Goldsmith of the musician Prince (l) and illustrations by Andy Warhol based on the image, including an illustration published in Vanity Fair’s November 1984 issue with the following credit: Lynn Goldsmith.
Putting the two images of Prince side by side, the appeals court ruled Warhol's piece wasn't transformative because it ""recognizably"" derived from and retained ""the essential elements"" of Goldsmith's photograph.

 said in a statement
  A federal grand jury indicted Nicholas Dombek, 53, Damien Boland, 47, Alfred Atsus, 47, and Joseph Atsus, 48, on charges of conspiracy to commit theft of major artwork, concealment or disposal of objects of cultural heritage and interstate transportation of stolen property, the U.S. attorney's office said.
  
Attorneys for Dombek and Alfred and Joseph Atsus did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment.
  
The indictment alleges that Dombek burned the painting ""Upper Hudson"" by Jasper Cropsey, valued at approximately $500,000, to avoid its recovery by investigators for use as evidence against the members of the conspiracy.
  
According to the indictment, the suspects allegedly transported the stolen items back to Dombek's home in northeast Pennsylvania, where the metal items were melted down into transportable bricks and discs.
  
The long list of items allegedly stolen also includes the paintings ""La Grande Passion"" by Andy Warhol and ""Springs Winter"" by Jackson Pollock, stolen in 2005 from the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania; six championship belts from the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York; and five trophies worth over $400,000 stolen in 2013 from the National Racing Museum & Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York.

In a case that could help clarify when and how artists can make use of the work of others, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide a copyright dispute between a photographer and Andy Warhol's estate over Warhol's 1984 paintings of rock star Prince.
The justices took up the Andy Warhol Foundation's appeal of a lower court ruling that his paintings - based on a photo of Prince that photographer Lynn Goldsmith had shot for Newsweek magazine in 1981 - were not protected by the copyright law doctrine called fair use.


After Goldsmith challenged that decision, the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year found that Warhol's paintings had not made fair use of the photo, allowing Goldsmith's case to proceed.


A judge ruled that Warhol's works were protected against Goldsmith's infringement claims by the fair use doctrine, finding they transformed Goldsmith's portrayal of Prince as a ""vulnerable human being"" by depicting him as an ""iconic, larger-than-life figure.""","Copyright Infringement

On Monday evening in a charity auction at Christie’s, Warhol’s 1964 silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe, “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn,” is estimated to sell for about $200 million, which would be the highest price achieved for any American work of art at auction.
Christie’s made the most of its Warhol prize with a theatrical presentation before the sale; at the auction house’s preview, a red carpet led toward a lit sign, “Warhol’s Marilyn,” before visitors entered the darkened room that held the lone painting illuminated in a new large white frame.
In kicking off the spring auction season in New York, Christie’s Monday night event is widely viewed as a bellwether for the two weeks of sales ahead, as well as an indicator of the wider health of an international art market still emerging from the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.



Decades later, that rivalry continues to play out in the market arena: In 2017, a Basquiat skull painting brought $110.5 million at Sotheby’s, eclipsing the sale of a Warhol car crash painting for $105.4 million in 2013.","Fine Art

Nearly 70% of the art in The Now sold above the high end of presale estimate ranges, as five artist auction records were set.

The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with a photographer who claimed the late Andy Warhol should have honored her copyright on a photo of the rock star Prince when creating an iconic image of the late singer.
Vanity Fair commissioned Warhol to create an illustration for a 1984 article on Prince and obtained a license from Goldsmith, paying her $400 to use the photo as an artistic reference for Warhol.
The justices were considering whether Warhol, who died in 1987, violated copyright law by selling to Vanity Fair magazine an illustration based on a silk-screen portrait of Prince.
When Prince died in 2016, Vanity Fair’s parent company Condé Nast paid more than $10,000 to the Warhol Foundation for another version, Orange Prince, to illustrate a commemorative magazine.","Copyright Infringement

Federal prosecutors say Bouaziz, a French national who hailed from Algeria, was busted in a sting last year after trying to sell an undercover FBI agent a group of paintings that included multiple fakes for $22 million, including a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat for $12 million.


The FBI launched the undercover operation after law enforcement received numerous reports from customers saying Bouaziz had sold them fake paintings and had ceased all communication after they had complained, prosecutors said.


Prosecutors say Bouaziz often produced phony provenance documents and that numerous paintings had forged artists’ signatures done with a mechanical pen.
Daniel Elie Bouaziz, who ran Danieli Fine Art and Galerie Danieli on Palm Beach’s ritzy Worth Avenue, admitted buying knockoffs of paintings by famed artists online for as little as $100 and then selling them on to unsuspecting art collectors for as much as $240,000.

With the debut joint exhibition of the two artists, KAWS + Warhol, “the dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time,” the museum says.


A wooden sculpture from KAWS will stand in The Warhol’s new Pop Park space, located across from the museum.


KAWS + Warhol will open at The Warhol on May 18 and runs until January 20, 2025.

“Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” is one in a series of portraits Warhol made of the actress following her death in 1962 and has since become one of pop art’s best-known pieces.


“‘Shot Sage Blue Marilyn’ is the absolute pinnacle of American Pop,” Alex Rotter, chairman of 20th and 21st Century art at Christie’s, said in a statement announcing the auction.


Its title refers to an incident in which a woman shot at a stack of four Marilyn portraits in Warhol’s studio with a pistol, although “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” was not struck by a bullet.
The sale broke the previous record for an American artwork at auction of $110.5 million set in 2017 for a 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat.","Fine Art

Instead of commenting on mass culture from the peaks of fine art, as his earliest Pop works had seemed to do, by 1964 Warhol was silk-screening images that could take their place among the commodities of mass culture such as Campbell’s soup cans and Brillo pads and Marilyn in her cheeriest “Seven Year Itch” incarnation.
The change that came about between Warhol’s two Marilyn series paralleled a change in Pop Art as a whole, which in just two years had gone from being a threatening new movement that shocked the art world to being the American public’s favorite new trend, with endless coverage on TV and in print.
You could say that in 1964, with the viewer-friendly repeats of his Marilyns, Warhol was embracing the movement’s new popularity, making works that were not just Pop Art but also truly popular art.
The original Marilyns from 1962 had been strange, distressed images, crudely silk-screened to leave blotches and blank spots that convey the decay and distress of the fallen movie star — it’s said Warhol conceived them right after Marilyn’s death, though there’s reason to believe that’s a myth.","Fine Art

Titled ‘Shot Sage Blue Marilyn’, the painting beat the American artwork record of $110.5 million (with fees) set by Jean-Michel Basquiat’s Untitled (1982) painting of a skull at a Sotheby’s New York auction in 2017.


“Warhol’s choice of the studio headshot, the close cropping of Marilyn’s face and the contrast of colour all draw the eye to Marilyn’s lips, which hinge between a smile and an expression of clenched teeth,” a report in The New York Times quoted Jessica Beck, curator of art at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, as saying.


‘Shot Sage Blue Marilyn’ (1964) is part of a set of five paintings called ‘The Shot Marilyns’.

FORT PIERCE, Fla. --
A South Florida art dealer was sentenced Tuesday to two years and three months in federal prison in connection with a scheme involving the sale of fake Andy Warhol paintings.


Prosecutors said Bouaziz, the owner of Danieli Fine Art and Galerie Danieli in Palm Beach County, sold counterfeit artworks to a customer in October 2021 including pieces purportedly by Warhol.


Bouaziz told the customer that the pieces, which he was selling for between $75,000 and $240,000, were authentic originals and that some were signed by the artist, investigators said.


Officials said the customer gave Bouaziz a $200,000 down payment that was deposited into Bouaziz’s account, and then the comingled funds were wired to other accounts.

The Warhol estate told the Supreme Court the 2nd Circuit's decision ""casts a cloud of legal uncertainty over an entire genre of visual art, including canonical works by Andy Warhol and countless other artists.
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to ponder in a case centering on paintings by the late artist Andy Warhol a question as philosophical as it is legal: what is the line between art and copyright theft when artwork is inspired by other material?
 
Goldsmith countersued the Andy Warhol Foundation for copyright infringement in 2017 after it asked a Manhattan federal court to rule that his works did not violate her rights.
The case centers on how courts decide when an artist makes ""fair use"" of another's work under copyright law.","Copyright Infringement

The court in a ruling authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor concluded that the works made by Warhol did not have a sufficiently different commercial purpose from that of the original photo taken by Goldsmith: Both are used to illustrate magazine articles about Prince.


In a win for photographer Lynn Goldsmith, the court ruled 7-2 that Warhol’s images did not constitute “fair use” under copyright law.


The next year, the issue ended up in court, with Goldsmith and the foundation suing each other to determine whether Warhol’s image constituted fair use.


But Goldsmith said she was not aware that Warhol had created other images that were not licensed, a fact she became aware of only after Vanity Fair publisher Condé Nast used a different image as part of a 2016 Prince tribute immediately after his death.

“‘Shot Sage Blue Marilyn’ is the absolute pinnacle of American Pop,"" Alex Rotter, chairman of 20th and 21st Century art at Christie’s, said in a statement announcing the auction.


Its title refers to an incident in which a woman shot at a stack of four Marilyn portraits in Warhol’s studio with a pistol, although “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" was not struck by a bullet.
The sale broke the previous record for an American artwork at auction of $110.5 million set in 2017 for a 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat.","Fine Art

This gives Serkis’ turn as director of Venom: Let There Be Carnage a delightfully twisted feeling of symmetry, steering the ship on another tale of man and CGI coming together to form two fleshed-out characters out of one actor’s performance.
Eddie (who, like Venom, is played by Tom Hardy), meanwhile, isn’t willing to pay much attention to the symbiote hiding in his skin because he’s too busy failing to win back his now-engaged ex Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), much to Venom’s disappointment.
While Let There Be Carnage is resolutely an action film — and a very funny one at that — it’s also tightly paced and built around three central relationships: Brock and Venom, Anne and her fiancé Dan (Veep’s Reid Scott, returning from the first film), and new villains Cletus Kasady/Carnage and Frances Barrison/Shriek (Naomie Harris).
And since Venom and Eddie are the heroes, one wonders what could the other couples — or all couples, really — learn from them?","Movies

Federal prosecutors say Bouaziz, a French national hailing from Algeria, was busted in a sting last year after trying to sell an undercover FBI agent a group of paintings that included multiple fakes for $22 million, including a copy of a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat for $12 million.


Banksy is the latest artist drawing attention to homelessness this holiday season

Prosecutors say that Bouaziz often produced phony provenance documents and that numerous paintings had forged artists’ signatures with a mechanical pen.
The FBI launched the undercover operation after law-enforcement officials received numerous reports from customers saying Bouaziz had sold them fake paintings and had ceased all communication after they complained, prosecutors said.


Several prospective buyers said they had gone to Bouaziz’s store and been shown paintings purportedly by the English street artist Banksy that would be worth millions if they were real but were being offered for $85,000.","Fine Art

Goldsmith won the justices over 7-2, disagreeing with Warhol's camp that his work was transformative enough to prevent any copyright claims.
In the majority opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, she noted that ""Goldsmith's original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists.
""

Indeed, the decision could have far ranging implications for fair use and could influence future cases on what constitutes as transformative work.
In this particular case, the court has decided that adding ""some new expression, meaning or message"" to the photograph does not constitute ""transformative use.""","Copyright Infringement

The justices upheld a lower court's ruling that Warhol's works based on Goldsmith's 1981 photo were not immune from her copyright infringement lawsuit.
  
Warhol created 14 silkscreens and two pencil illustrations based on the photo that Goldsmith had taken of Prince for Newsweek magazine in 1981, most of which were not authorized by the photographer.
  
She countersued the Andy Warhol Foundation in 2017 after it asked a court to find that the works did not violate her copyright.
  
At issue in the litigation involving Goldsmith was Warhol's ""Orange Prince"" series.

  ""Good morning,"" the Bravo host, 54, captioned his a capella act, through which Lucy sits beside her dad in a navy-blue onesie.
  
In July 2022, Cohen also sang the Grateful Dead's ""Candyman"" to his daughter, in a video post to which the band's official Instagram account left rainbow and lightning bolt emojis.
  
""Every week she gets a little more 'awake.'""
  Cohen has even improvised his own tunes — in 2019, he shared a video of his ""new single coming soon"" called ""Face Full of Feet"" in which Benjamin pushed against the dad's chin with his toes.
  
Between his television and radio gigs (and a newer position as crawling coach ), Cohen looks forward to mornings with his kids.

In the process of understanding and diving into songs, Frasco realized that ""songs were therapy for me.""
  Coming out the other end, Frasco recommitted to his songwriting, his music, his band.
Frasco is now in his mid-thirties and, as he told me recently in a zoom interview from his home in Denver, he has become much more at peace with himself and his place in the music ecosystem, while at the same time, feeling like he is continuing to grow as a songwriter and as an artist.
  
""I just fell in love with the music business,"" Frasco said.
But out of those feelings came the new album, L'Optimist
  Although it seems appropriate to quote Alfred, Lord Tennyson here ""that it's better to have loved and lost than not loved at all,"" Frasco says that he learned ""there's other ways to make yourself happy when you're not.""
  L'Optimist reflects some of that hard-earned wisdom, which you catch in seemingly innocent songs like Everything Bagel where Frasco's younger self would have taken the top of the everything bagel, but his older self wants to share it.

Yes, that Andy Kaufman—the eccentric actor and performance artist known for confounding audiences as much as entertaining them, and whose feud with Lawler on Letterman in 1982 helped push pro wrestling into the mainstream.
The Unbelievable Andy Kaufman, notes that while most casual fans know about the infamous Letterman appearance, few realize how deeply committed Kaufman was within the Memphis wrestling scene: for the better part of two years, right up until shortly before his death, Kaufman would appear on a near weekly basis at local shows.


For members of “Andy’s Army,” Kaufman’s impact on wrestling history is clear when you examine the timeline: less than a year after Kaufman’s death, Vince McMahon, who had just taken over the WWF from his old-school father, hosted the first ever WrestleMania and embraced Hollywood, enlisting celebrities like Cyndi Lauper, “Captain” Lou Albano, and Mr. T as main attractions.
According to Michael Kaufman, Andy’s younger brother, pro wrestling was always a defining influence on his brother’s career.","Profane Content

Referencing the work of Manchester city council leader Bev Craig and Mayor of Salford Paul Dennett, Andy said: “We have a new generation of people now in leadership positions.
We’ve been trading a bit too much in the past, focusing on the old days, we have to focus on the now of Manchester music, and that’s what this is all about.”

The group will also be joined by Oli Wilson, son of Tony Wilson, who will speak about Beyond The Music - a new music conference to take place annually in Manchester.


Terms such as ‘a new phase’ will likely intrigue music fans across Manchester - particularly while the struggles of music institutions across the city continues to hit the headlines.
This important conversation follows the recent divisive opening of Joy Division-themed bar Disorder in the Northern Quarter, which has reignited conversations around the city’s musical heritage, with many asking if Manchester is living too much off its musical past, rather than supporting the framework and institutions that allowed these bands to become so successful in the first place.","Music

For example, Andy Rivera has recently said something that has prompted the media and social networks to wonder if it was just part of his concert or if his words were really addressed to someone in particular.
Then, last Wednesday, April 13, the reggaeton singer shared from his TikTok account a video in which he is seen on the stage -without expanding the information about the place where he performed the show- and released the following message:

“What a turn that those who believe in love the most, the ones we give the most!

Los Galactacos String Band, at the Dunaway Center, 23 School St., in Ogunquit, on Saturday, May 20.
  
A true translator and ambassador of musical ideas, Happel has infused his music with elegant fire – ranging from Capitol Records' Thanks to Gravity and modern classical label PARMA, to his work with the Don Campbell Band, and his ever-expanding teaching studio.
  
The program titled ""A Tour of the Americas"" will take place at 7:30 p.m.
  Galactacos, the Spanish word for “galactic,” a loose translation for superstar or a boast of ability levels that are “out of this world,” would provide an apt descriptor of the band's new program: a tour de force of authentic, inspired musicianship, featuring the blazing fiddle work of violinist Andy Happel, dobro guitar and twin fiddle by Jonathan Cooper, bassist Drew Wyman and percussionist Sean Daniels.
   
Andy Happel is a concert violinist and fiddler who has shared the stage with symphonies, pop stars and country music luminaries alike.
Happel, a well-known and favorite musician of Ogunquit and visitor audiences, will be performing a lively repertoire of songs, as Los Galactacos brings together an exotic combination of voice, guitar, violin, cello, dobro, cuatro, upright bass, acoustic bass, guitarron, drums and percussion.

The mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham, has joked that he will put on a special night at live music venue the Warehouse Project, for Conservative MP Michael Gove.
Mr Gove, the new Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, is due to visit Manchester next week for the Conservative party conference, where Mr Burnham is expected to present ministers with a proposed “levelling-up” deal for Greater Manchester.
He also joked that he will make sure Mr Gove has an opportunity to dance, saying: “We are very keen to impress the new Communities Secretary so we are going to lay on a special Warehouse Project Hacienda night.”
Whatsmore, Mr Gove, who hails from the city, apparently purchased drinks for fellow clubbers throughout the night.
Mr Khan used his opportunity on the decks to poke fun at Mr Gove, telling the packed event: ‘’The best place in Brighton in this conference week is Dawn Butler’s Jamaica party,” reported The Daily Mail.","U.S. Government Resources

Nor will the Court's decision, which is consistent with longstanding principles of fair use, snuff out the light of Western civilization, returning us to the Dark Ages of a world without Titian, Shakespeare, or Richard Rodgers.”
  Copyright law experts said the Warhol decision will have the effect of enshrining the first of the four factors in the fair use test as the most important measure for adjudicating copyright infringement claims.

  James Corden Voices 'Disgust and Anger' at Supreme Court for Overturning Roe v. Wade
  The Supreme Court's Warhol decision hinges on the legal concept of “fair use,” which allows for the use of copyrighted works without the owner's permission in certain circumstances such as for writing criticism or commentary about those works, or for use in news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research.
The decision notes that a more liberal reading of fair use could allow more famous artists to profit off the work of lesser-known creators by claiming that the work is transformed just by association with a boldface name such as Warhol.
In this case, however, Goldsmith's photograph of Prince, and [Warhol Foundation's] copying use of the photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine devoted to Prince, share substantially the same commercial purpose.","Copyright Infringement

“During the last writers strike, we were providing all the entertainment, and that's really when the gold rush of reality TV started.”
  Frankel added that networks and streamers shouldn't be able to continue profiting from stars without recognizing the impact of reality shows on Hollywood.
There are a lot of people who didn't get fed.”
  In July, just a week into the double strike, Frankel shared a video on Instagram of her bringing up the idea of a reality TV union.
“So either I'm missing something, or we're getting screwed too.”
  Bravo also recently clarified the network's nondisclosure agreements after NBCUniversal received letters from lawyers representing cast and crew on Bravo, E! and CNBC series regarding alleged “grotesque” mistreatment and “draconian” nondisclosure agreements
  A spokesperson for the network previously shared in a statement with The Hollywood Reporter , “Confidentiality clauses are standard practice in reality programming to prevent disclosure of storylines prior to air.
“And right now, during this strike, they're going to be the ones that everybody goes to for cheap labor.”
  After Frankel first took to social media last month to question why reality TV hasn't unionized, she has since been working with lawyers on a plan of action.","Arts & Entertainment

It’s a bold move for a man accused of misappropriating some $844,000 in pandemic relief tax dollars while operating a casino at his Draft Sports Bar and Grill in Concord, N.H. He owns the business with his wife, Rep. Laurie Sanborn (R-Bedford), who was forced by the scandal to give up her position as chair of the state’s new commission to review charitable gaming practices.
Sanborn is “not suitable to be associated with charitable gaming in New Hampshire due to evidence of COVID-19 relief fraud involving Concord Casino’s charitable gaming business,” according to state Attorney General John Formella.
(Tony Schinella/Patch)

New Hampshire’s attorney general may believe Andy Sanborn is too corrupt to be in the charitable gaming business, but the former GOP state senator clearly doesn’t agree.
When he announced the charges against Andy Sanborn, Formella — who also sits on the new charitable gaming commission — made it clear he takes them very seriously.","Law, Gov’t & Politics

However, Overman teased that this modern-day version will still ""explore the same themes of sacrifice, superstition, and ritual that were at [the original movie's] core.""

Serkis's involvement is intriguing.
What is curious about this is that the original ""Wicker Man"" does not have any elements -- at least on the surface -- which would theoretically require motion capture technology.

When it was announced that Duran Duran was bestowed with the honor of the Hall of Fame alongside Dolly Parton and Eminem, Le Bon revealed to Rolling Stone that the OG members — even Andy — would be reuniting for their momentous induction ceremony.
Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, John Taylor, and Roger Taylor attended the ceremony (via ABC News), but Andy Taylor left a letter for the band to read during their speech.
In the letter (via Duran Duran's website), Andy revealed that his absence was due to an unfortunate ""setback"" in the treatment for his Stage 4 prostate cancer, which he was diagnosed with four years ago.

While making a case that the network thrives on a culture that “thrives off drug and alcohol use,” McSweeney’s lawsuit claims that Cohen, 55 — who is an executive producer of “RHONY” and “RHUGT” and hosts Bravo’s late night show, “Watch What Happens Live” — “engages in cocaine use with Housewives that he employs” and that “Cohen’s proclivity for cocaine usage with his employees is well-known throughout the Real Housewives franchise.”


Meanwhile, the papers claim that a producer employed by Shed Media, which makes “RHONY” and “RHUGT” as well as a number of other “Real Housewives” shows, “routinely sends unsolicited pictures of [their] genitalia to lower-level…production employees.”

4 Cohen is an executive producers of “Real Housewives of New York City,” the host of late-night chat show “Watch What Happens Live!”
4 Leah McSweeney, who has open about her struggles with substance abuse and mental health issues, is suing Bravo, Andy Cohen and a production company that makes “Real Housewives of New York” and “Ultimate Girls Trip.”
Court documents filed on Tuesday by one of its former stars, Leah McSweeney, even claim that it’s an open secret that the network’s figurehead, Andy Cohen, snorts cocaine with a coterie of his favorite “Real Housewives” stars, and doles out special professional favors to his employees-cum-personal-party-pals.

But McCluskey is keen to point out that Wade is not a “northern artist” in the tradition of LS Lowry: “The way he painted was, frankly, just less sentimental.”
And in a way they should never have been pop stars – compared to the cool customers on the Liverpool scene that formed around Eric’s club (Echo and the Bunnymen, Dead or Alive, Teardrop Explodes), McCluskey stood out with his huge afro and baggy clothes.","Fine Art

“The initial piece of inspiration is actually kind of sad, someone pretty close to me suffered a traumatic brain injury and then sort of healing from that, which took a while, was a crazy thing to watch,” Petsos revealed to Yahoo Canada.


While we can be relieved that Petsos’ friend has now recovered, it’s that old tale about finding humour in difficult situations that reigns true for Big Gold Brick.
The film retrospectively tells the story of aspiring writer Samuel Liston (Emory Cohen) who is enlisted by Floyd Deveraux (Andy Garcia) to write his biography, after Samuel’s near-death experience in a car accident with Floyd.
As Samuel tries to understand Floyd’s life for this biography, which is far more secretive and odd than initially expected, particularly involving Oscar Isaac’s villainous character Anselm, Samuel is also experiencing his own hallucinations and flashbacks to his life pre-brain injury.","Movies

“The Movie Emperor” is cinema, designed to be screened on the biggest possible screen, as DP Wang Boxue constructs each shot the way Jacques Tati might have: from such a distance that each location starts to feel dehumanized and absurd — as when Dany attends the Hong Kong Film Awards.
  
“In Chinese films, it's all about cotton padded jackets,” explains director Lin Hao (played by Hao) at a wardrobe fitting where Dany tries on the uniform of stereotypical salt-of-the-earth Chinese farmers (essentially the safer version of the “Simple Jack” joke in “Tropic Thunder”).
  
Reteaming with “Crazy Stone” director Ning Hao for an ultra-polished, good-sport parody of A-list vanity, Lau plays Dany Lau — not quite himself, but a megastar of roughly his own stature.","Arts & Entertainment

“These are four lion cubs,” explained Sabin, who is an activist for endangered animals.
Sabin, the head of conservative conservation organization Conserve America, has helped with animal crises stemming from Hurricane Dorian and wars in Libya and Ukraine.

  He also supports new directing talent through his Beijing-based production outfit Dirty Monkey, which produced Wen Muye's Dying To Survive and Shen Ao's cyber fraud drama No More Bets , which grossed more than $500M in China over the summer.
  
More from Deadline
  In a thinly veiled satire of China's film industry, Lau plays an old school movie star trying to regain relevance in the TikTok era by playing a pig farmer in a ‘serious' Chinese drama aiming for film festival exposure.
DEADLINE: What gave you the idea for the film and did you always plan to cast Andy Lau?
  NING HAO: I've always wanted to partner with Andy Lau because 17 years ago he invested in my film Crazy Stone , at a time when it was really difficult for new filmmakers to raise finance, but we could never find the right project to work on together.
Ning also stars as the artsy director making the film.

The performance would be their first in 16 years with original guitarist Andy Taylor, who left the band for the second time during the 2006 recording of the never-released Duran album Reportage
  But then, just one day before rehearsals and three days before the Rock Hall ceremony, Duran Duran were blindsided by the news that Taylor would not be joining them all after — due to his stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer, which he'd kept secret after being considered, as Taylor reveals to Yahoo Entertainment, “terminal for five years.”
  “We'd kept it just sort of within the family and a few sort of friends and stuff.
Original Duran Duran drummer Roger Taylor, in a separate 2023 interview for an upcoming Yahoo Entertainment story on Danse Macabre , has even revealed that the band has “definitely made a decision to go back and work on those Reportage songs with Andy and get that released, because there's some really great stuff on there.
When there's not, it doesn't.”
  In 2021, Duran Duran bassist John Taylor described Reportage to Yahoo Entertainment as “us attempting to write a modern alternative-rock record,” and said when Timbaland and Timberlake were brought into the mix, “That was the point where really Andy sort of separated himself from the group.
The announcement of Taylor's illness, read by grave-faced lead singer Simon Le Bon during the band's acceptance speech at the start of the Hall ceremony on Nov. 5, 2022, cast a pall on the rest of what should have been one of the greatest nights of both Duran Duran and Taylor's lives.","Arts & Entertainment

Last month, NBC and Bravo reality show stars accused the networks of 'covering up sexual violence, condoning revenge porn, exploiting minors and denying mental health treatment' in a bombshell letter obtained by DailyMail.com

Stars complained of 'grotesque and depraved mistreatment', with the letter claiming both current and former stars were 'mentally, physically, and financially victimized'.

Setting the tone for their sold-out Forum gig, Depeche Mode fittingly, if riskily, opened with Memento Mori 's elegiac and dirge-like first track, “My Cosmos Is Mine,” followed immediately by that album's equally atmospheric and somber “Wagging Tongue.”
  While the band's only overt acknowledgment of “our friend, Mr. Andrew Fletcher” was during 1990's “World in My Eyes” — which they played in front of a slow-dissolve vintage video of Fletch cupping one hand over his eye — Fletch's presence, or absence, was deeply felt throughout the night.
While Depeche Mode have made no official announcement that this will be their last album or tour — at an October 2022 press conference, Gahan said he and Gore decided, “Let's at least make this record” — an Uncut review did describe Memento Mori as the sound of a “band entering a final act.”

Cohen smiled and agreed as he said all the Housewives were 'champions.'

While preparing to sit down with the two Real Housewives of Potomac stars, the 55-year-old Bravo veteran filmed a video of himself telling the ladies 'it's showtime'

After letting the duo know it was time to appear on the daytime talk show, Bassett, 37, and Osefo, 39, were seen strutting out of their dressing room in full glam

During the episode, Clarkson asked Bassett and Osefo if they had any 'requests' for future seasons or spinoffs to their franchise

Osefo went on to thank Bravo and Cohen for making her the first Nigerian housewife on their show's history

After the episode, Clarkson shared a photo with her guests.

'LEAPing into today's Kelly with @bravoandy and #RHOP @therealcandiace and @wendyosefo!'
McSweeney told the court that producers failed to make a 'reasonable accommodation' for her addiction-related disability - but instead provided her 'with unlimited, free-of charge alcoholic beverages,' and 'encouraged her to consume those alcoholic beverages.'

A rep for Cohen told Dailymail.com that 'the claims against Andy are completely false'

McSweeney's legal team said that 'this environment caused Ms. McSweeney to relapse into alcohol addiction shortly after joining RHONY season 12.'

McSweeney said in court docs that Bravo producers sought to sabotage her sobriety by both exacerbating it and stopping her from getting treatment for her problem.


McSweeney said in legal docs that Bravo and Shed Media, a production company it works with on its shows, continued to promote the unnamed senior producer in question 'to positions of increased power.'

In 'failing to take appropriate remedial action' amid the claims, McSweeney said in court docs, Bravo and Shed officials 'tacitly' signaled to both the senior producer and 'all other employees that they can engage in unlawful employment practices with impunity.'

McSweeney in her suit, which is for unspecified damages, named Cohen, Bravo, Shed Media and Shed's parent company Warner Media.
The appearance comes after Cohen former Real Housewives of New York City star Leah McSweeney accused him of engaging 'in cocaine use with Housewives that he employs' in a new lawsuit.

Stage: The 80s singer and lead singer of the synth-pop duo, 59, took to the stage at the Rewind South Festival in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire to perform an array of the band's hits including A Little Respect, Always and Sometimes

Sorry: A festival has been forced to issue an apology to disgruntled fans following Erasure singer Andy Bell’s 'below par performance'


Shambolic: Festival goers were left far from impressed as they complained that Andy sang out of tune, with the performer even losing his microphone at one point after dropping it

Gone: So shambolic was the set, that it sparked a mass walkout by furious music fans who'd had enough of the show

One person fumed: 'The headline act too!
Raging.'

While another shared: 'Well, that was an interesting end to #rewindsouth.
Reaction: Watching his performance, a number of fans took to social media to complain, with several leaving the show early due to his set

Group: Peterborough-born Andy formed Erasure alongside keyboard player Vince Clarke, 63, (left) in 1985 (pictured in 1990)

'Unbelievably embarrassing' commented a fifth.

The facility is scarcely insignificant: “IMS owns and operates integrated film and television facilities in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, which includes film stages, television studios, water filming tanks and production support facilities.
By the time the facility opened in June 2014 – then branded as Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios – inbound films and TV shows were told they would be able to take advantage of a new 30% production rebate scheme that was administered by FINAS and had backing from another branch of Khasanah.
Although it is 330 km from Malaysia's film capital and biggest city Kuala Lumpur, IMS was promoted as both part of a larger infrastructure initiative and as a new creative hub for the Asia-Pacific region.
  Built on the site of a former palm oil plantation and within eyesight of Singapore, the IMS project was spearheaded by the Malaysian government's sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional Berhad.
GHY has shot at least three shows there: “The Little Nyonya – New Edition,” “The Ferryman – Legends of Nanyang,” and “Sisterhood. ”
  So far, however, the studios have failed to persuade any major Hollywood film to use IMS as its core facility.

His reason why

Heritage Auctions’ website crowed that when Warhol put his Pop Art spin on Botticelli’s painting, he “re-contextualized the classical image for contemporary audiences.”
He made the news last week when Heritage Auctions sold his Pop Art version of Sandro Botticelli’s 15th-century painting “Birth of Venus” – an insurgency if there ever was one - for $325,000.


ArtDaily, reporting the sale at Heritage Auctions, classed Warhol’s work as “The King of Pop Art’s indelible interpretation.”
The mindless look of Venus in Warhol’s print makes clear that when he saw Botticelli bringing back the humanist values of ancient Greece, where even the gods were rendered in the image of man, he said to hell with it.

I wondered two things:
  Is there an equivalent of the Turing Test for AI's creative output?
  Could I have an AI system that was an analogue of myself and knew me so well that it produced exactly what I would do, but without me actually having to do it?
  I decided to use Midjourney and devise some tests to see if it knew its stuff when it comes to the subtleties of art and design and also to see if it could learn my own style.
Most AI's rules usually block any requests for actual gory content, but maybe this got through the filters by being the wrong shade of red?
  Keeping the same base image reference, I changed the prompt slightly to add some more details (“graphic pen, line drawing”) to more match my style.
In fact some artists were being accused of using AI because some of their original work came out looking like AI imagery that had been generated by other people, asking for it to be rendered in that artist's style.

  Would you have been able to tell the difference between this and the machine's efforts?

The jury ultimately decided that Von D’s tattoo was not substantially similar to Sedlik’s photograph, and the social media postings of the tattoo were covered by the fair use doctrine.
 
Von D’s attorneys argued that the tattoo fell under the fair use doctrine, as it was an artistic interpretation.
At trial, Sedlik’s attorneys argued Von D’s actions could influence millions of others to steal photographs.
Von D created the tattoo without obtaining a license from Sedlik, and she then posted the image to social media.

This May, The Andy Warhol Museum marks its 30th anniversary, an occasion set to reinforce Pittsburgh’s position as a must-visit city for cultural enthusiasts.
For fans of pop art, the museum offers a deep dive into the life and work of the iconic Andy Warhol, a Pittsburgh native whose influence transcends the boundaries of art.
 
On 19 May 2024, the museum invites art lovers to engage with Pittsburgh’s creative community through activities like mural making and more, continuing Warhol’s legacy of bringing together diverse artistic expressions.
For those eager to trace Warhol’s steps, here are seven experiences to immerse yourself in his world:
 Explore Warhol’s Roots: Each floor of the museum highlights a different decade of Warhol’s career, beginning with his early influences from comic books and Hollywood glamour during his formative years in Pittsburgh.
Originally from Pittsburgh, Warhol’s legacy in the city is palpable, not just in the museum but across the urban landscape—right down to a steel bridge named in his honour.","Arts & Entertainment

BRATTLEBORO — Filmmaker Andy Reichsman, of Marlboro, will visit the Brattleboro Museum & Art Center (BMAC) on May 2 to share his extraordinary story of reclaiming family artwork stolen by the Nazi-aligned Yugoslavian government during World War II.
  
For half a century, Dane's daughter — Reichsman's aunt — fought in court to compel Croatia's National Museum of Modern Art, the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the Zagreb Museum of Arts and Crafts to return the collection, which included paintings by André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminick and lithographs by Paul Cezanne, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Pierre Bonnard.
The Zagreb Museum of Arts and Crafts still holds 19 pieces that Reichsman and his lawyer in Croatia continue to pursue.
  
Three Croatian museums returned paintings, lithographs and small copper and bronze pieces — about a dozen objects altogether — that once belonged to Dane Reichsmann, Andy Reichsman's paternal grandfather.","Arts & Entertainment

In Vogts v. Penske Media Corp., a U.S. District Court for the Central District of California case decided in August, the court also granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on the defendant's fair use affirmative defense.
 
In the lone case finding fair use in favor of the secondary user, Kelley v. Morning Bee Inc., decided in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in September, a photographer sued the Morning Bee publication for showing 10 photographs in the background of a film the Morning Bee produced regarding the musician Billie Eilish.
 
In that case, the court held that Andy Warhol's silkscreens of the musician Prince based on a photograph taken by the photographer Lynn Goldsmith did not satisfy the first ""fair use"" factor and therefore infringed on Goldsmith's copyright.

In Whyte, the circuit court specifically referenced Warhol in holding that the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma misapplied the first fair use factor in granting summary judgment to Netflix on the basis of fair use.","

Andy Warhol ICONS includes famous works such as Elvis Campbell's Soup Cans (1968) and Marilyn
  When thinking about international pop art, it's hard to think of someone more famous than Warhol.
The exhibition plays with themes of repetition, authenticity and pop culture in a suite of Campbell's Soup Cans (1968), repetitive prints of Mona Lisa (1970) and Elvis
  While some viewers may have seen Warhol artworks in the flesh, many might be more familiar with these pieces online.
Seeing these artworks in Wanneroo continues Warhol's contradictory play on viewers' expectations around high art, capitalism, pop culture and the everyday.
Consequently, Andy Warhol ICONS is likely to attract audiences local to the commercial centre of Wanneroo, or die hard art history fans from Perth willing to trek along the Kwinana Freeway.

Here's what Andy Reid says","Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid has an initial plan with recently signed Louis Rees-Zammit
 For now, that involves the former professional rugby player starting the season as a running back to “get him to feel comfortable with that.”
  “He'll get used to some of these (offensive) calls — through our Zooms — and the plays,” Reid said this week, “and then we'll just see where it goes from there.”
  
The 23-year-old Rees-Zammit, listed at 6 foot 3 and 194 pounds on the Chiefs' roster, announced earlier this year he'd be quitting rugby to pursue an NFL career.
The NFL's new kickoff rule could help Rees-Zammit's roster hopes as a potential special-teamer; touchbacks will return to the 30-yard line, meaning kickoff returns will likely be a more prominent part of the game.
  
“So I think that's definitely going to be something different for him, but I know he's excited, and we're excited as well.”
  Rees-Zammit could have extra opportunity with the Chiefs thanks to NFL rules.
When asked if Rees-Zammit might figure in as a returner with special teams coach Dave Toub, Reid said, “Potentially.”
  “We're just going to see how it goes here,” Reid said.","Sports

 After spending years in the company of Kaufman making the film, Braverman feels that maybe the question of – who is the real Andy – is actually back to front.
While Kaufman was depicted in the 1999 film, Man on the Moon, starring Jim Carrey, which also spawned its own documentary, Jim and Andy: The Great Beyond, Braverman felt there was still a bigger story to tell – especially when he was able to get hold of previously unseen archive material to do so.
“ It’s the yin and yang constantly at odds,” Safdie says, describing Kaufman and in many ways the film itself.
The film does a magnificent job of capturing this multi-layered existence of Kaufman’s life, as it unfurls in equal parts sincerity, spirituality, surreality, and silliness.","Arts & Entertainment

Described by the exhibition’s curator Michał Rut as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, Warhol is recognized as an art revolutionary, the founder of pop art, and a pop culture icon.


The exhibition in Rzeszów is entirely based on the collections of that museum, which is currently undergoing a comprehensive renovation, Poland’s PAP news agency has reported.


“This is an artist who transitioned from a successful graphic designer in advertising to celebrity status, whose popularity rivaled that of film stars and pop music idols,” Rut told the PAP news agency.

The Andy Warhol Foundation appealed a lower court’s ruling that his 1984 paintings – based on a 1981 photo of Prince that celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith shot for Newsweek magazine – were not protected by a copyright law doctrine called fair use that allows certain unlicensed use of copyright-protected works.


Kagan noted that a 2021 Supreme Court ruling on fair use of software cited Warhol as an “example of how somebody can take an original work and make it be something entirely different, and that’s exactly what the fair use doctrine wants to protect”.


In lively arguments that touched on the meaning of art and referenced famous films, TV shows and paintings, US Supreme Court justices have grappled with a copyright dispute between a photographer and Andy Warhol’s estate over the acclaimed artist’s paintings of the rock star Prince.


Some justices expressed scepticism about the lower court’s ruling that judges should not consider an artistic work’s meaning in determining fair use.

“Being an avid diver and underwater photographer, the effects of unsustainable fishing practices are far too visible, and it's clear that if nothing is done, we might not be able to continue to enjoy our beautiful ocean playground for years to come.”
  Every year LegaSea runs a photo competition to highlight NZ's coastal environment and get people engaged and interacting with our coast in different ways.
  
“It was also a great chance to get behind photography of landscapes and coastlines, which is essentially what our artwork celebrates.”
  Belcher, who turned 80 in October, 2023, said he was nowhere near as active as he used to be.
  “Entering the competition was a way to put something positive into my brain again.”
  Despite a career in photography that's taken him around the globe and opened up the vibrant underwater world, it can be the small-town stories of home that stay front of mind.
  
Born in 1943 in England in the middle of World War II, Belcher began his underwater photography career after coming home to New Zealand from Australia and Papua New Guinea in the late 70s.
  
Two of his underwater photos, captured while diving at the Poor Knights Islands, have also claimed second and third prizes in the Underwater Photos category, and another photo of a West Coast, South Island beach shot at sunset won first place in the Landscape Coastal Shots category.

Pop artist Andy Warhol’s famed 1964 silk-screen portrait of Marilyn Monroe has sold for $195m, becoming the most expensive 20th-century artwork ever sold at a public auction.
The sale beat the previous record for a 20th-century work, Pablo Picasso’s Women of Algiers, which sold for $179.4m in 2015.
Its estimate was $200m.

“‘Shot Sage Blue Marilyn’ is the absolute pinnacle of American Pop,” Alex Rotter, chairman of 20th and 21st Century art at Christie’s, said in a statement announcing the auction.

The SCOTUS today handed down its long-awaited decision in the Warhol Foundation vs Goldsmith copyright infringement case involving Warhol’s Prince series based on Goldsmiths photo re the boundaries of fair use and when a work is an infringement vs a transformative use.
pic.twitter.com/RlxHKn0vG1 — Michael Kasdan (@michaelkasdan) May 18, 2023

An appeals court had previously reversed a lower court ruling that Warhol’s art transformed Goldsmith’s depiction of a “vulnerable” musician into a “larger-than-life” figure.


The ruling on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in a lawsuit brought by celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith in relation to a 1981 photograph she had taken of singer Prince.
The appeals court said that Warhol’s paintings were closer to adapting Goldsmith’s photo in a different medium than transforming it.

After several operations to remove damaged cartilage in his left knee, and after the strain of this Spring’s marathon tour, he had booked the operation to allow him to perform (probably on crutches) three weeks before the charity trust night.
It is with great sadness and regret that Andy has had to pull out of the performance due to the date for an essential knee replacement operation being moved to seven days before the Gala night at the cathedral.


To Andy - best of luck with the operation, and getting back on stage with those sell-out tours.","Arts & Entertainment

GREENWICH, CT.- A new exhibition of Andy Warhol’s works on view at the Bruce Museum provides art enthusiasts the opportunity to see some of the 20th century’s most celebrated and quintessentially American images at an intimate scale.
 
“Andy Warhol: small is beautiful” is presented in partnership with the Hall Art Foundation and will be on view inside the Grossman Family Gallery and Barbara and Edward Netter Foundation Gallery at the Bruce Museum.
Later, his work would blur the lines between art and commerce with images that were steeped in the era’s advertising, consumerism and mass media, challenging ideas of what constituted fine art and pop culture.
 
“Andy Warhol: small is beautiful,” on view April 9-Oct. 13, invites viewers to look closely at iconic works in a more personal size—some as diminutive as 5-by-5 inches.","Arts & Entertainment

However, Ted Fraser, a former curator who began his career in 1971 at the Art Gallery of Windsor — now known as Art Windsor-Essex — told the Star that he feels the gallery is making an “irrevocable decision to auction off a pillar of the permanent collection.”

 When Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol started working together in 1983, the artists were at very different points in their careers.
“Nearly 40 years later, the collaborative works are now, rightfully, seen as a landmark and an integral part of both artists' bodies of work, synthesizing their contrasting styles and visions with total iconoclasm.”
  The $18 million price tag doesn't come close to either artist's most expensive individual paintings ( $195 million and $110.5 million for Warhol and Basquiat, respectively).
New York Times art critic Vivien Raynor accused Warhol of using the young Basquiat to bolster his reputation and reestablish his significance, while the young artist “[came] across as the all too willing accessory.”
In a statement from Sotheby's, Elliott describes the work as a “masterpiece of juxtaposition and contradiction: the cool, mechanical restraint of Warhol's imagery, overlaid with Basquiat's anarchic energy and freewheeling technique.”
  Warhol went first, covering the canvas with sports imagery like baseball mitts, tennis rackets and sneakers.
Basquiat was quickly gaining notoriety for his graffiti art and Neo-Expressionist works, while Warhol had been a Pop Art star for decades.","Style & Fashion

“There are collections of Paul Kane's work in the United States which can be a rarity for Canadian artists.”
  With the sale at auction, Matotek says the gallery will be able to create a fund for the purchase of new art that meets their mandate of Canadian historical, Indigenous and contemporary pieces that have ties to the Windsor-Essex region.
  
As for the Andy Warhol piece, Cowley says its no surprise there is global interest in the work given Warhol's stature as “arguably the best known contemporary artist in the world and … the grandfather of pop art.”
  Deaccessioning art ‘healthy' process for art galleries, museums
  Cowley said the firm is happy to be part of the auction, and will donate its commission fees back to the AWE endowment fund for the sale of the pieces.
  
Cowley Abbott, a Toronto-based art auction house, will action two Art Windsor-Essex (AWE) pieces in late May: A Paul Kane oil painting, Party of Indians in Two Canoes on Mountain Lake , dated from the 1840s, and an Andy Warhol print of Wayne Gretzky.
  
She says the gallery recently undertook a review of the pieces in its collection to identify works to deaccession — museum-speak for sell or remove from the gallery's collection.

  Appointments are available at The Warhol Kennedy Residence , London WC2.
William John Kennedy's most intriguing body of work was rediscovered in the mid noughties when he and his wife found a set of negatives and transparencies that he had taken of artists Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana from 1963-1964, a crucial moment in their respective careers.
– Marie Kennedy, The Guardian
  Kennedy's archive has been the subject of a coffee table book William John Kennedy: The Lost Archive (ACC, 2022) and an acclaimed documentary Full Circle (2010) which includes moving footage of Kennedy reunited with Robert Indiana and surviving Warhol superstars.
Based in the heart of London, the Warhol Kennedy Residenc e is home to a largely unseen archive documenting two true giants of late 20th Century art, the genuinely iconic Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana.

The series showcases not only the distinctive genius of two singular artists, but also an entirely new artistic voice created in a momentary flash that would never again be replicated,” shares Gregoire Billault, Sotheby's Chairman of Contemporary Art, in an official statement
  The Merging of Minds
  As Billault has stated, “Untitled” is an amalgamation of the distinctive styles that made Basquiat and Warhol so popular within the art world.
Keith Haring, another art world behemoth, would watch some of these sessions, remarking : “It was a physical conversation happening in paint instead of words.”
  Warhol and Basquiat would go on to create 160 works over two years, and many of these pieces—including “Untitled” (1984) —became the centerpieces of the successful 2023 retrospective Basquiat x Warhol:
The Then and Now
  Though many art circles today hold high regard for these Basquiat and Warhol works, this wasn't always the case—especially when the artists first revealed them to the public in the 1980s.
The relationship itself contained perspectives from two different eras, as Sotheby's states that Basquiat was a young yet already famous talent in the art world by 1983, while Warhol's career skyrocketed years before in the 1960s.

The Prints of Andy Warhol , although never shown at the MoMA in New York, traveled to the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain in Jouy-en-Josas in France (15 June 1990–9 September 1990), the Národní Galerie in Prague in Czechoslovakia (24 September 1990–17 November 1990), the Staatliche Kunstsammlung in Dresden in Germany (former DDR) (10 December 1990–27 January 1991), the Mücsarnok in Budapest in Hungary (13 February 1991–24 March 1991), and the Muzeum Narodowe in Warsaw in Poland (17 June 1991–28 July 1991)
  Based on the materials from the Museum of Modern Art Archives and the Andy Warhol Museum Archives, the current paper analyzes the cultural–political context of The Prints of Andy Warhol .
Between New York and Paris: Arbitrating the Political Geography of the Eastern European Tour of The Prints of Andy Warhol
  Since the MoMA did not collaborate closely with the Eastern European museums during the Cold War, it did not know for sure if the exhibition tour of The Prints of Andy Warhol would run smoothly or not.
The paper concludes by examining the broader impact of The Prints of Andy Warhol on both the growing awareness of American pop art in Eastern Europe and MoMA's cultural diplomacy in this region after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

 GREENWICH, CT – A new exhibition of Andy Warhol’s works coming to the Bruce Museum provides art enthusiasts the opportunity to see some of the 20th century’s most celebrated and quintessentially American images at an intimate scale.
 
The new Bruce opened April 2, 2023, featuring state-of-the-art exhibition, education and community spaces, including a changing gallery for art and five new permanent galleries in the William L. Richter Art Wing; a changing gallery for science, the Robert R. Wiener Mineral Gallery, a permanent science exhibition, “Natural Cycles Shape Our Land;” three classrooms in the Cohen Education Wing; a café; an auditorium and grand hall.

 About the Bruce Museum Located in Bruce Park overlooking Greenwich Harbor, the Bruce Museum is a community-based, world-class institution that offers a changing array of exceptional exhibitions and educational programs to promote the understanding and appreciation of art, science and the intersections between the two disciplines.
The first exhibition at the Bruce Museum took place in 1912 and featured works by local artists known as the Greenwich Society of Artists, several of whom were members of the Cos Cob Art Colony.","Arts & Entertainment

Two weeks ago, Orange Coast College discovered that one of Warhol's signed silkscreen prints of Mao was missing from its vault.
A summary of the Mao portraits by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York says this about the series: ""As interpreted by Warhol, these works, with their repeated image painted in flamboyant colors and with expressionistic marks, may suggest a parallel between political propaganda and capitalist advertising.""
  In 1982, Warhol visited China and took a photo in front of the portrait of Mao in Tiananmen Square.
Doug Bennett, executive director for college advancement at Orange Coast College, told VOA's Mandarin Service that the print was purchased by a person close to the school from a gallery in Laguna Beach, California, in 1974 and donated to the school anonymously in September 2020.
  
From 1972-73, Warhol used the image of Mao from the Little Red Book, widely circulated in China, as a template to create 199 richly colored Mao silkscreen works in five series.

This portrayal reminded many netizens of his past role as an overweight character in the film “Love on a Diet.”
  Upon seeing Lau's photo with white hair, some netizens mistakenly believed that the superstar was indeed experiencing a drastic ageing process.
In the shared photo on the social media platform Xiaohongshu, Lau was captured in a drastically different appearance, with a head full of white hair and a protruding belly, making it difficult for some to recognise him.
However, a recent photograph of Lau taken by netizens while filming his new movie, “A Cool Fish 2” in Italy, has raised concerns about his apparent ageing.
  
Once this fact became known, netizens praised Lau for his dedication and work ethic, commenting, “He's really pushing himself,” “He's pushing himself even at this age,” “He's incredibly professional,” “Doesn't he need rest?”","Arts & Entertainment

The biggest single-artist museum in this country, it contains a large collection of Warhol’s paintings, drawings, and sculptures, as well as extensive archival materials.
Opened in 1994, the Warhol Museum contains a useful permanent display of his major works, changing exhibits of some marginal Warhol ephemera, exhibitions by other artists, and his archives.
The Andy Warhol Museum is a branch of the Carnegie, housed separately some miles from that institution in a marvelous seven-floor refurbished building on the North Side of Pittsburgh, within walking distance of downtown.
And so, the very real question facing the Warhol in Pittsburgh was finding a role for such a museum.","Arts & Entertainment

Painting by Basquiat and Warhol Heads to Sale at Sotheby’s","An untitled 1984 painting done by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat will sell at Sotheby’s in a contemporary art evening sale this May, making it one of the top lot of that marquee auction week.
The record for one of the Basquiat-Warhol pictures is $11.3 million, achieved in May 2014 at Phillips during a contemporary art evening sale in New York.
But both artists fully exist on the canvas, working in their different vernaculars of the same subject matter.”

Basquiat-Warhol paintings typically perform well at auction, even if they net prices that are far beneath the eight- and nine-figure sums regularly achieved by these artists individually.
Speaking of the untitled work headed to auction, Lucius Elliott, head of evening sales devoted to art of the past few decades at Sotheby’s, told ARTnews, “It really is the apex of their collaboration.
Things were created.","Arts & Entertainment

“Of all the Warhol-Basquiat works from this brief and fertile moment, Untitled stands out as one of the supreme examples, fully showcasing the range of their artistic powers,” said Lucius Elliot, Sotheby’s head of contemporary marquee auctions in New York, in a statement.
In 2023, Warhol and Basquiat’s joint works starred in the Basquiat x Warhol: Painting Four Hands retrospective at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, with a selection of the paintings later traveling to New York’s Brant Foundation.


Andy Warhol x Jean-Michel Basquiat’s early lukewarm reception

Warhol and Basquiat’s joint efforts were unveiled in 1985 at an exhibition at Tony Shafrazi Gallery, where their paintings were largely panned.
Warhol’s record was set in 2022 with the $195 million sale of Shot Sage Blue Marilyn at Christie's, while Basquiat’s was established in 2017 when his 1982 painting Untitled fetched $110.5 million at Sotheby’s.

The visit to Burnley Mechanics Theatre will be a first for Horace, and he will be backed by the Dub Asante Band, one of the UK's finest reggae groups, with the promise of a night filled with the authentic sounds of roots reggae, lovers, dubwise and early dancehall.


Mia Laffy, marketing lead for cultural services at Burnley Leisure and Culture (BLC), which runs the Mechanics, says: “The mix of Horace's engaging vibes and the historical significance of the setting guarantees a must-see performance.


“It’s important that we support live music in our town.”

Burnley Mechanics Theatre, a Grade II-listed building, opened as an entertainment venue by HM Queen Elizabeth in 1987.


Horace Andy, also known for his work with Massive Attack, will be performing at the Mechanics on Maundy Thursday, March 28.

These include Skull, The Last Supper, Silver Clouds and Andy Warhol on the Red Couch.
  When snapped through the lens of photographer and director James Emmerman, who has previously shot for The New York Times, Forbes, Nike and Vogue, these images allow the campaign to serve as a testament to the enduring legacy of Andy Warhol's work and his cultural impact on late twentieth-century art.
  
Titled 'It's Not Just Art, It's an Experience', the campaign highlights the fact that The Andy Warhol Museum is not merely a place to look at his art like a regular gallery.
""We love that the resulting work reads as if your favourite social media influencers immersed themselves fully in our lively installations,"" says Rick Armstrong, Director of Marketing and Communications at The Andy Warhol Museum.
  
""We're grateful to have partnered with the talented team at BarkleyOKRP on this effort and look forward to welcoming new visitors to experience The Andy Warhol museum themselves this year.""

William John Kennedy's most interesting pieces of work were rediscovered in the mid-90s when he and his wife stumbled upon a set of negatives of photographs of artists Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana from 1963-1964 , years said to be pivotal for both of their careers.
  
This collaboration between Kennedy first began in 1963 when he met Indiana at an art opening in New York, it was shortly after working with Indiana that he was then introduced to Warhol at the Americans exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in May of 1963.
  
Kennedy's archive has been featured in a coffee table book titled ‘William John Kennedy: The Lost Archive (ACC, 2022)' and also featured in a critically acclaimed documentary titled ‘ Full Circle' (2010) which showcased video footage of Kennedy reuniting with Indiana and surviving iconic subjects of Warhol.
  
An entire London residence will dedicate its space to exhibit the forgotten photographs of Andy Warhol and American printmaker central to the pop-art movement, Robert Indiana.","Arts & Entertainment

Organized for the gallery by Jessica Beck, formerly of the Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, the exhibition considers Warhol's ongoing cultural impact by juxtaposing key paintings, photographs, and films by the artist with works by some of his contemporaries and successors, including Derrick Adams, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Urs Fischer, Nan Goldin, Douglas Gordon, Alex Israel, Takashi Murakami, Richard Prince, Nathaniel Mary Quinn, Sterling Ruby, and Zeng Fanzhi.
Collections include Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul; Bibliotèque nationale de France, Paris; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Musée d'Art Contemporain, Marseille, France; Tate, London; Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Museo Jumex, Mexico City.
Warhol's work has been the subject of exhibitions throughout the world, including retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1989), and Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (2001–02, traveled to Tate Modern, London, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 2002).
A new painting by Takashi Murakami echoes Warhol's Flowers by abstracting from nature to create an instantly recognizable form, while Sky (2012) by Alex Israel recalls the Pop artist's embrace of artificiality.","Arts & Entertainment

Harries will receive the BPG's prestigious Harvey Lee Award for Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting for a career spanning more than four decades and including such television classics as The Crown The Royle Family Prime Suspect and Cold Feet as producer and Arena and The South Bank Show as director.
  
Left Bank Pictures also found success at the cinema, with Harries serving as producer on The Damned United and Stan & Ollie
  In 2016, The Crown became Harries' biggest TV project – telling the story of the modern royal family from 1947 to 2005 and winning critical acclaim and reaching huge audiences around the world.
In 2000, he became Granada's controller of drama, where he produced hit TV shows including the return of Prime Suspect and Cracker The Street The Deal Dirty Filthy Love Longford and 2006 film The Queen – which not only won Helen Mirren an Oscar but also sparked the idea for the Netflix hit series The Crown a decade later.

""

AWF was represented by Latham & Watkins’ Roman Martinez and Andrew Gass and trial lawyers Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan’s Luke Nikas and Maaren Shah

Following the ruling, Latham said that given that Goldsmith has now withdrawn any claim that Andy Warhol violated her copyrights when he created the Prince Series in 1984, “the Foundation is happy to put this litigation to rest and move forward with its work supporting up-and-coming artists.
According to district court filings, AWF has agreed to pay Goldsmith $10,250 for its 2016 Condé Nast licence.


When Goldsmith informed AWF that she believed its use of her photograph infringed her copyright, AWF sued her.


Last May, SCOTUS rejected the fair use defence and found that AWF had infringed the copyright of her 1981 photo of Prince in Warhol’s silk screens of the music artist.

The case addressed
 the question of whether Warhol's use in his own work of a photo of the musician Prince by Goldsmith constituted fair use: The US Supreme Court, in a 7–2 ruling, determined that it did not
  The case focused on Goldsmith's allegation that the late Pop artist illegally used her 1981 photo of His Royal Badness in his 1984 “Prince Series,” a group of screen prints featuring the rock icon's face.
She launched her suit after Vanity Fair, in the wake of Prince's untimely 2016 death, ran a different work from the series, Orange Prince , in a commemorative issue, paying the Warhol Foundation $10,000 and leaving Goldsmith out in the cold in terms of both cash and (photo) credit.
Warhol created the series while on assignment for Vanity Fair , whose parent company, Conde Nast, licensed the photo from Goldsmith for onetime use, paying her $400.
Those cases focus on Prince's unauthorized use of Instagram photos, and likewise hinge on issues of transformation and fair use.

Resolution Reached in Manhattan Federal Court

In a filing on Monday in Manhattan federal court, it was revealed that AWF will compensate Goldsmith with $10,250, reflecting a 2016 license agreement with Condé Nast, which utilized a Warhol silkscreen titled “Orange Prince” for a magazine cover following the musician’s demise.
The apex court’s landmark ruling last year, rejecting Warhol’s claim of fair use concerning his silkscreens of music legend Prince, based on Goldsmith’s original photograph, sets a new precedent in copyright law.


Legal Landscape

The legal saga began when AWF initiated legal action against Goldsmith, seeking a declaratory judgment that Warhol’s silkscreens did not violate Goldsmith’s copyright of a Prince portrait, citing transformative art.
However, the Supreme Court, in a decisive 7-2 ruling last May, determined that the “Orange Prince” silkscreen failed to qualify for fair use protection, as it served a similar commercial purpose as the original photograph.","Law, Gov’t & Politics

Last year, the Supreme Court sided 7-2 in favor of Goldsmith, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing in the majority opinion that the photographer’s “original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists.”

“Fair use” is a legal doctrine that permits the limited appropriation of intellectual property for purposes such as scholarship and news reporting, and has become a barometer of sort for the state of freedom of expression in America.
The judges, however, did not apply this decision to the entirety of Warhol’s “Prince Series.”

“AWF’s position is that the original creation of the Prince Series was fair use, and that nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion undermines that view,” the foundation wrote in the joint filing.
Goldsmith stated in court documents that she was aware that the image was used by Warhol for the Vanity Fair commission and that he would subsequently use it as the basis for several artworks collectively dubbed the “Prince Series.”
Blockbuster cases involving major artists who rely on appropriated images, such as Jeff Koons and Richard Prince, have based their defenses on the doctrine, placing judges in the position of deciding whether the new artwork was appropriately “transformative”—that is, if it altered the original with “new expression, meaning or message,” per a precedent established in 1994 by the Supreme Court.

As for allegations that he had neglected the museum’s core mission, he told WESA at the end of last year: “The traditional mission of the museum is to provide opportunities for our community.”

An exhibition of Warhol’s work in Saudi Arabia was also highly criticized during Moore’s tenure.
The 10-year initiative was announced by Moore in 2022 but it swiftly drew criticism from the museum’s own employees.


The museum’s CEO Steven Knapp said Moore’s initiatives, among them the Pop District, “significantly advanced the reputation and impact of Carnegie Museums as a whole.”
The Carnegie Museums will soon begin recruiting Moore’s replacement, but in the meantime the museum’s deputy director Rachel Baron-Horn will serve as interim director.

In Friday’s court filing, the AWF agreed to pay $10,250 based on the Conde Nast license while maintaining that “the original creation of the Prince Series was fair use,” and “nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion undermines that view.”

Goldsmith states in the court document that she is “not advancing claims for relief for the original creation of the Prince Series because the statute of limitations has already expired.”

Million Dollar Case

In an interview with Billboard magazine, Goldsmith revealed the eye-watering financial impact the case had on her — requiring her to sell her home.


The Supreme Court only focused on the specific use of Conde Nast licensing Warhol’s work and did not rule on Warhol’s entire series based on Goldsmith’s work.


The copyright litigation was jointly resolved on Friday when Goldsmith told a New York federal court that the case had been ended after Warhol’s estate agreed to pay her more than $21,000, including $11,000 in court costs.


Goldsmith only became aware of Warhol’s work when the images were republished in May 2016 after Conde Nast licensed them from the Andy Warhol Foundation (AWF).","Society

“Today I could never do what I did 30 years ago, when I could walk into a gallery and buy a small piece for a thousand dollars,” said McCoy, whose art finds are the subject of the recently published book Out of Sight: An Art Collector, a Discovery, and Andy Warhol , which was inspired by an exhibit at the University of Pennsylvania in 2022.
When McCoy approached Penn Libraries about displaying the work, David McNight, then-director of the rare book and manuscript library, recalled being both intrigued and unsettled about curating a Warhol exhibit in which the very authorship of the art was questionable.
  
The Philadelphia Art Museum currently has 490 of the artist's works in its collection, including Brillo boxes like McCoy's, while the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts owns 171 screen prints and photographs, said McNight.
  
Pop art itself was a rip-off of commercial art, and elevated it in an ironic way … overall it was fair to examine the collection within the chain of events that occurred from 1965 to the present at Penn.”
  About 1965: McNight was referring to an event held at Penn's then newly established Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA) — Warhol's first-ever solo museum exhibit — that sealed both Warhol and the ICA's reputations.

Moore cites personal plans to move to Spain as his reason, but ArtNews notes that his departure comes amid continuing controversy over the so-called ‘Pop District', a $60 million, 10-year masterplan Moore has been pursuing to transform the neighbourhood surrounding the Warhol Museum.
  
Moore said in his leaving statement: ‘My 13 years at The Warhol have been the most formative of my life, and I'm so grateful for having been given this opportunity.
The district, stretching four blocks, will include ‘a Creative Entrepreneur Lab', for teaching business acumen to adults, and ‘The Warhol Creative', in which children will learn digital content production skills with the opportunity to produce material for the museum and companies including computer giant Dell and Howmet Aerospace, local radio station WESA reports.
In recents years several senior curators and administrative staff left the museum, with one former staff member telling WESA that the general feeling was the district took the museum away from its core role of researching and conserving the legacy of Andy Warhol.","Arts & Entertainment

Rockmaker (Sunset Boulevard)











Packed with high-profile features and drenched in fuzz, The Dandy Warhols’ pearl anniversary offering, Rockmaker, leans into moody, industrial-tinged rock in a move away from the experimental delirium of their last album, 2020’s
It’s hard to tell if this release wants to take itself seriously, but for those firmly in the Dandy Warhols’ fold, it may be a welcome measure of star-studded nostalgia.


A largely unexceptional instalment, Rockmaker is peppered with only the occasional memorable hook: satiating moments include cleverly-titled lead single Danzig With Myself and the dark, driving charge of The Summer Of Hate.
However, contrary to its sincere and concrete instrumentation, the album’s lyrical output straddles the margins of an incongruous silliness.","Arts & Entertainment

This unique event will be at the Sound Forge, Mucurapo, where Rudder had his marathon 7.0 birthday concert last May, which included Narell.

MANHATTAN (CN) — The Andy Warhol Foundation on Friday agreed to pay celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith more than $21,000 to put to rest copyright litigation that made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, according to a joint court filing
  The foundation's law firm Latham & Watkins said in a statement that it was “happy to put this litigation to rest and move forward with its work supporting up-and-coming artists.”
  “The foundation wishes Ms. Goldsmith the best,” the firm added.
  
The Warhol Foundation said in the Friday filing that it would pay Goldsmith $10,250 “based on the 2016 Conde Nast license and the Supreme Court's decision.”
  “Lynn Goldsmith's original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the 7-2 ruling last year.
  
In this case, the Supreme Court determined that Warhol's use of Goldsmith's photo wasn't fair use in the case of the Conde Nast magazine, since both works served the same commercial purpose.
  
“[Andy Warhol Foundation's] position is that the original creation of the Prince Series was fair use, and that nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion undermines that view,” the foundation said in Friday's filing.

During Moore's time as director, the institution proposed a $45 million expansion plan last year that would increase the institution's footprint by more than 60 percent, as well as its $60 million “Pop District” initiative
  The 10-year Pop District initiative would span five blocks around the museum in Pittsburgh's North Shore and would include a “public art initiative, a youth-focused, creative economy workforce program, flagship live event & performance venue.”
  The Pop District in particular has proven particularly controversial among staff at the museum, according to WESA , Pittsburgh's local NPR station.
“After having had a sabbatical in 2023 where my husband and I were able to spend three months at our home in Spain, I have decided our future is there, in his home country.”
  Moore said he was happy to be leaving “on the high note of the museum's 30th anniversary and the opening of my KAWS + Warhol exhibition.”
  After May 31, Deputy director Rachel Baron-Horn will serve as interim director of the Warhol Museum while Carnegie Museums of PIttsburgh searches for Moore's replacement.
  
But by the time the controversy transcended the museum, making it into the local press after the Instagram account Change the Museum posted about the label, it appeared that Levi Garvey had left the institution, with his LinkedIn page suggesting that he no longer held that position, according to the Pittsburgh City Paper
  There had also been scrutiny over a 2023 exhibition of Warhol's work that the museum organized in Saudi Arabia.
Moore denied this, telling WESA , “The entire senior staff of the museum has been involved with the Pop District from day one.”
  A separate controversy has plagued the museum in the past month.","Arts & Entertainment

Under Moore's leadership, the Warhol Museum launched its Pop District initiative, a ten-year project aimed at creating a cultural hub occupying a half-dozen blocks surrounding the museum.
As well, Moore in recent months received blowback for allowing the museum to loan artworks for a Warhol show in AlUla, a 2,000-year-old archaeological and historical site in northwestern Saudi Arabia that the government is attempting to remake as an international arts destination: Detractors accused him of aiding the Saudi government in “artwashing” its execrable human rights record.
“I'm happy to be leaving on the high note of the museum's 30th anniversary and the opening of my KAWS + Warhol exhibition the weekend of May 17,” Moore said in statement.
However, as reported by radio station WESA , many top-level museum staffers—some of whom departed after the district's launch—felt that the project took attention away from the institution's mission and criticized Moore as having an uncommunicative and opaque management style.","Arts & Entertainment

“And I look forward to continuing to collaborate with and support my many friends at The Warhol and Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.”

Moore joined the Warhol Museum as the director of development in 2011, and assumed other leading administrative roles at the museum before being appointed director in 2017.

In 2021, Moore was invited by Arts AlUla to consider Saudi Arabia as a venue for Fame, an exhibition of Warhol’s works that eventually materialized in 2023.
Moore acknowledged the criticisms in an opinion piece on Artnet that year, noting that he stood by his decision to host the exhibition at AlUla after seeing how the Saudi youth interacted with the work, specifying that Warhol’s living relatives were involved in the exhibition, and that “international relations will shift for the better” through education and cultural exchange.","Arts & Entertainment

Are you glad to hear Andy and Barbara Muschietti will be heading up a new genre label at Skydance?
“

Dana Goldberg, Skydance’s chief creative officer, added: “ Andy and Barbara are visionary filmmakers who have mastered the art of scary event movies that connect with global audiences, and David and I along with the entire Skydance team are thrilled to partner with them on the launch of Nocturna.
The Hollywood Reporter broke the news, and also revealed that the first feature being developed for the Nocturna label is called They Will Kill You.

Written by Kirill Sokolov and Alex Litvak, They Will Kill You is set to be directed by Sokolov, who previously wrote and directed the 2019 Russian-language action comedy Why Don’t You Just Die.
It’s fitting that They Will Kill You will be our first project, as it perfectly encapsulates Nocturna’s mission of delivering unique and entertaining horror experiences that will live in the audiences’ nightmares for years.","Arts & Entertainment

“Alongside Warhol's pop portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Kennedy, ‘Portrait of Princess Diana' exemplifies the artist's unique ability to select timeless images that distill not only the captivating essence of his subjects, but – under the artist's treatment – of celebrities “Icons of their time,” adds the auctioneer.
In fact, Warhol painted the various portraits (in different colors) that make up the series based precisely on the official photograph of Charles and Diana's engagement, taken by Lord Snowden and widely circulated at the time.
  
“More than any other artist, Andy Warhol redefined the role and imagery of the icon for the 20th century.
“Here, a young and radiantly beautiful Lady Diana Spencer looks at the viewer with an openness and warmth that, years later, would describe her as the ‘people's princess,'” says Philipps, describing the play, which was performed after Carlos and Diana's wedding, the previous one Year.

“Andy Warhol put America on the map,” said Castillo.


According to Iannitelli, she would like to see more younger artists learn more about Warhol’s impact, and to expand their knowledge into all art forms.


Last year, Castillo reached out to multiple artists, to ask if they would be interested in his “Homage to Andy Warhol” exhibition.
She said Warhol launched the “Pop Art movement” when she was 14 years old.

“Proved himself to really be a genius in the art world,” Iannitelli said.","Arts & Entertainment

“He wanted to represent his practice across the board — his paintings, the works on paper and the silkscreen prints — so we collected his subject matter and his medium comprehensively.”
  Visitors to the Wanneroo gallery will have the opportunity to see Elvis, famed portraits of Monroe, Jackie Kennedy, Mick Jagger and Elizabeth Taylor and renowned images from Warhol's Campbell's Soup and Electric Chair series.
  
Last month, Mitzevich waved his favourite goodbye and sent it across the Nullarbor with 52 other Warhol works to take up residence in the Wanneroo Regional Gallery for the next two years.
  
Mitzevich hopes the exhibition will shape people's understanding of Warhol's significance, his ability to transform the way subjects were seen.
  
The artwork was painted by Warhol in New York in 1963 but it has lived in the National Gallery since it was bought by the inaugural director, James Mollison, in 1973.

The complaint, which refers to Cohen as the “Real Housewives omnificent ringleader,” goes on to allege that “Cohen intentionally uses cocaine with his employees to further promote a workplace culture that thrives off drug and alcohol abuse, which leads to a failure to accommodate employees who are disabled and attempting to remain substance free.”
  A representative for Cohen responded to the allegations, telling Deadline “the claims against Andy are completely false!”
  McSweeney's lawsuit, meanwhile, claims the fashion designer is bringing “this action to hold Defendants' accountable for their unlawful employment acts of disability discrimination, hostile work environment, retaliation, sex and gender discrimination.”
  “Reality always reveals itself: these unconscionable practices will no longer be tolerated; the pattern of discrimination and retaliation must stop — it is time that Defendants answer,” the complaint states.
  
The former Real Housewives star called her experience on the show a “rotted workplace culture that uniquely depended on pressuring its employees to consume alcohol,” and claimed that Cohen “engages in cocaine use with Housewives and other Bravolebrities that he employs.”
  “Your favorite Bravo shows are run by people who create a dangerous work environment, encourage substance abuse to artificially create drama and cynically prey on the vulnerabilities of their employees,” McSweeney added in a statement posted to her Instagram account on Tuesday.
  
Cohen reportedly wasn't surprised by McSweeney's lawsuit, as the former Real Housewives of New York City star had openly threatened to take him, Bravo, NBCUniversal, production company Shed Media and various producers to court after her employment discrimination action with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was thrown out.
  
“Defendant Cohen's proclivity for cocaine usage with his employees is well-known throughout the Real Housewives franchise,” McSweeney's lawsuit claims, according to a report by Deadline.

The story goes that when Andy Warhol debuted Campbell’s Soup Cans at L.A.’s Ferus Gallery in 1962, a neighboring gallery mounted a pyramid of the supermarket staple with a sign offering the “original” thing at “two for 33 cents.”


Fifty years on, MoMA faced a different kind of headscratcher when it came to staging “Andy Warhol: ‘Campbell’s Soup Cans’ and Other Works, 1953-1967”.
MoMA decided to revive the presentation and since Warhol had left no instructions it opted for the chronological order in which Campbell’s had introduced the soups to market.
The dilemma facing MoMA’s curators was that, except for the original Los Angeles exhibition, the cans had largely been shown in a four-by-eight grid formation (including during sporadic stints on Blum’s dining room wall, wherever else).","Arts & Entertainment

Kennedy remembered exhibiting the image only once at an exhibition at the Sydney Janis Gallery in 1967 in New York City, titled ‘Homage to Marilyn Monroe,' which featured works by various renowned artists including Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana, Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson, John Chamberlain, Salvador Dali, Willem de Kooning, Robert Indiana, Marisol, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Tom Wesselmann, alongside William John Kennnedys image.
  
Can you give a bit of insight into the photographs and why these 30 were chosen for the exhibition and accompanying museum edition portfolio, which has been created exclusively for the Andy Warhol Museum?
  JB: When curating the exhibition, we carefully examined the remarkable portfolio of images captured by William John Kennedy of Andy Warhol.
This exhibition, titled ‘Homage to Marilyn Monroe,' showcased works by various renowned artists, including Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana, Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson, John Chamberlain, Salvador Dali, Willem de Kooning, Robert Indiana, Marisol, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Tom Wesselmann, alongside Kennedy's own image.

  McSweeney, who has been very vocal about her past alcohol abuse and the work she's done to overcome that addiction, centers her suit on the claim that Cohen and other production higher-ups allegedly preyed on her weakness for alcohol.
Most shockingly in the suit, McSweeney alleges that Cohen snorts cocaine with a group of his favorite Housewives stars and hands out favorable tips and angles to help their careers.
McSweeney alleges that Bravo execs and Shed Media producers coaxed or outright coerced her with attempts to try to get her to drink in order to do controversial things on camera and boost show ratings.","Arts & Entertainment

  The suit goes on:
  “[That same producer] in diametric opposition to [their] obligations as an employer encouraged Ms. McSweeney to relapse and told her that the RHONY season 13 fans would like her more during the season if Ms. McSweeney still consumed alcohol.”
  Later, McSweeney claimed that after she signed up to do Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip , she was assured that she would have access to AA meetings once the women got to Thailand.
In this suit, McSweeney claims:
  “[Bravo and the producers] discriminated against, tormented, demoralized, demeaned, harassed and retaliated against Ms. McSweeney because she is a woman with disabilities, such as alcohol use disorder and various mental health disorders, all in the name of selling drama.
The lawsuit states:
  “[One of the producers] called Ms. McSweeney and told her that, despite relapsing into alcohol use disorder, Ms. McSweeney should continue to consume alcohol so long as she ‘remain[ed] lucid' while filming.'”
  After the end of season 12, McSweeney was able to regain her sobriety, and she signed up for another season.
Per her suit, producers:
  “…not only supplied Ms. McSweeney with unlimited, free-of charge alcoholic beverages throughout Ms. McSweeney's employment as a cast member on RHONY season 12, but also encouraged her to consume those alcoholic beverages.","Society

The screen tests, or “stillies” as Warhol called them decades before the word “selfie” appeared, featured celebrities and artists – Bob Dylan, Dennis Hopper, Yoko Ono, Salvador Dali, Marcel Duchamp – along with others Warhol deemed worthy, quite often the beautiful, lustworthy young men and women who made up his stable of superstars.
 Gallerist Ki Smith worked with Gregory Pierce, director of film and video at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, to select a series of screen tests of subjects who would reflect the gallery’s abiding downtown ethos.

 At the same time, Pierce said, the breakneck pace at which Warhol made the screen tests was typical of his artistic process, which was suggested in one of the artist’s frequently quoted remarks: “Don’t think about making art, just get it done.”

 Page Six
  The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, 51, claims the Watch What Happens Live host, 55, sent her a video in 2022, in which he appeared “obviously inebriated.”
  Cohen allegedly “boasted” in the clip that he wanted to “sleep with another Bravo star” while “thinking” of Glanville, per the letter, and invited the former Housewife to watch him engage in the sexual act via FaceTime.
  
Glanville and her team are threatening to pursue legal action and have asked NBC, Shed Media and Warner Bros. to preserve all documentation that may be pertinent to their case.
  Where to find help
  If you or someone you know is experiencing sexual abuse or family violence contact:
  National Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence Counselling Service 24-hour helpline 1800 RESPECT on
  24-hour Emergency Accommodation helpline on
  Safe At Home helpline on
  National Violence and Abuse Trauma Counselling and Recovery Service on 1800 FULLSTOP (1800 385 578).
Aside from Cohen, Freedman and Geragos claim in the letter that NBC and Shed Media are allegedly “deliberately misconstruing an interaction” between Glanville and a production executive named Shawn Loesser.
  
The letter from Glanville's lawyers — written by lawyers Bryan Freedman and Mark Geragos — comes on the heels of Caroline Manzo's lawsuit against Bravo, in which she accuses production companies involved with the network of not protecting her during an alleged sexual assault incident with Glanville.
  
Mr Loesser has always been transparent about his attraction to Ms. Glanville.”
  Reps for Loesser, Shed Media and Warner Bros. could not immediately be reached for comment.

Warhol’s foundation initially won their case, securing a court order declaring that the artist’s creation was transformative and thus legal under the doctrine of “fair use,” a defense against claims of copyright infringement.


The case asks whether Warhol infringed on a photographer’s copyright when he used her Prince portrait as the basis for a silkscreened rendering that graced the pages of Vanity Fair — or if Warhol’s artistic work was transformative, and thus legal.


The appeals court ruled that Warhol’s work amounted to an “unauthorized derivative” that was “substantially similar to the Goldsmith photograph as a matter of law.”
The litigation concerned a Prince image shot by celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith, who alleged that Warhol’s later work infringed on her copyright.

The court ruled that Warhol’s silkscreen infringed upon the copyright of celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith, rejecting arguments that its use was transformative enough to constitute a “fair use.”

“To rule otherwise would potentially authorize a range of commercial copying of photographs, to be used for purposes that are substantially the same,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority.


Goldsmith’s company had licensed her photo of Prince to Vanity Fair so Warhol could use it as an “artist reference” to create a one-time illustration of Prince for the magazine’s November 1984 issue.
The foundation then preemptively sued Goldsmith, seeking a court declaration that Warhol’s work did not violate copyright laws.
Goldsmith’s portrayal was more photorealistic, whereas Warhol’s silkscreen portrayed Prince as iconic, the foundation argued.

“Let’s just say I’m both a Prince fan — which I was in the 80s,” Thomas was heard saying in audio broadcasts of the oral arguments.


Justice Elena Kagan asked her colleague, to laughs heard in the courtroom.

Andy Frasco & The U.N. took the stage at the Metro Chicago on Saturday, the same night Widespread Panic was due to end a three-night stand at The Chicago Theatre that was postponed due to “unexpected health issues”.
Andy Frasco & The U.N. stayed faithful to the original version of “Porch Song,” which Widespread Panic has performed over 1,100 times since 1986.
Frontman Andy Frasco shouted out Panic several times over the course of the evening and told the crowd “We had to open the show with some fuckin’ ‘Porch Song,'” during “What More Can I Say.”

It also shattered a previous Warhol record — prior to Monday, the auction record for one of his pieces was set in 2013 when “Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)” sold for $104.5 million, notes the Times.


While falling short of the estimated sale price, the piece still made American auction history.
The piece, signed and dated “Andy Warhol / 64,” was expected to fetch a price of over $200 million.
Had it sold for that amount, it would have become the highest-selling piece of 20th-century artwork at an auction, according to The New York Times.","Jewelry

  ﻿Speaking on air, Andy also revealed that he's met Taylor Swift five times, he's even performed with the superstar.
  
Andy recalled that at the time someone sent him a video of Bec singing along at the concert to Taylor's lyrics, ""We are never, ever getting back together"".

“The Seventies in Color” will focus on three trendsetting New York City artists of the 1970s — fashion designer Stephen Burrows, musician-actor-model Grace Jones and fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez — to demonstrate the influence of Black and Brown creative labor across multiple fields.


McMillan said the book will advance an alternative view of the culture-defining New York arts scene of that era.


“However, the stubborn focus on figures like Andy Warhol and Halston, and places like Studio 54, has occluded attention to artists of color who are treated as ancillary figures when they were making impactful contributions to commercial and creative industries, mainly through the apparatus of style.”

McMillan began working on the project during the summer of 2020, just months into the COVID-19 outbreak.
“The standard narrative around New York in the 1970s is that cheap rents encouraged artists to move in and create amidst widespread crime and social unrest,” he said.","Style & Fashion

The risk of fraud is particularly heightened for potential collectors of works by Warhol, one of the most prolific and popular artists of his generation.
After four years of collecting and selling Warhol’s works, he purchased two counterfeit paintings that he believed to be by the artist.
Today, as well as being one of the most reputable dealers of works by Warhol, Rivlin is at the forefront of the battle against art fraud.


 Upholding this legacy, Revolver, in collaboration with Artsy, will offer a selection of 100 Warhol works at a range of price points, including prints, trial proofs and uniques, complete portfolios, and paintings.","Hobbies & Interests

It’s a difficult industry to navigate at the best of times, and the prospect of these tools being trained on the work that artists, designers and illustrators have produced is concerning.
As I had always been artistic and creative, a relative who was working in the card craft industry offered me design work which I was able to do from home.
As for books, there’s a series called “The Illustrators”, which cover the life and works of Judith Kerr, Ludwig Bemelmans, Dick Bruna and many others.
As for looking for work, by all means use amazing platforms like Creativepool, but primarily, I find that talking with people and building relationships is the best way to discover exciting opportunities.

The “Screen Tests” are among Warhol's most famous works.
Patrick Moore, executive director of the Andy Warhol Museum, said in a statement, “Hollywood was a source of endless fascination and inspiration for Warhol
so it's fitting that his films would now serve to inspire new generations of artists and filmmakers.”
  Sonya Roth, deputy chairman of Christie's, said the show marked a “convergence of film, art, and history.”
While there are occasionally moments of drama—poet Ann Buchanan cried during hers, in a work that is not going to be presented here—the “Screen Tests” are largely plain, and that, for many, has been part of their charm.

 Andy Warhol once thought it would be downright glamorous to be reincarnated as “a great big ring on Liz Taylor's finger.”
Bell, who is currently producing a documentary on Warhol, was keen to display the Screen Tests , Moore said, to spotlight the Film Initiative and “how much support the films need to be preserved and made accessible.”
  Not least, that Warhol's Screen Tests would go on view in L.A., the heart of America's moviemaking machine, seems apropos to an artist who always looked to the stars.
This work has enabled modern-day showcases of the Screen Tests, such as in a 2009 series of concerts, where the films were accompanied by musicians Dean & Britta's haunting soundtrack , and in 2015, when they were splashed across Times Square billboards as part of a Midnight Moment
  The Christie's exhibition will present eight of these portraits, including ones of Dennis Hopper, Bob Dylan, Salvador Dalí, Lou Reed, and Niki de Saint Phalle.
“Andy Warhol Screen Tests” are on view at Christie's Los Angeles, 336 N Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, California, February 27 to March 14.
  
He called them his Screen Tests

Moore’s life as a gay man in New York City is a recurring influence on his choices regarding Warhol’s work.

The exhibition closed on January 28 and consisted of over 250 works, including paintings, prints, photographs, films and installations, as well as the iconic Campbell's Soup Cans and Marilyn Monroe images.
The exhibition opened in October and attracted the highest visitor count in the history of the gallery.

Our long-standing commitment to building distinguished art collections; putting on world class, museum scale exhibitions that are freely accessible to the general public; and working closely with prestigious institutions around the globe, has only enhanced our expertise in showcasing and handling his work.”
  Kate Brown, Halcyon Gallery's creative director and curator of the exhibition, said: “This exhibition is a comprehensive overview of Warhol's creative life, from his earliest artworks and illustrations to the last works he ever produced.
Halcyon Gallery's smaller exhibition space, at 29 New Bond Street, celebrates Warhol's iconic Campbell's Soup Cans , which are accompanied by ephemera that illustrates the extraordinary impact that the artist's best-known motif has had on culture.
Writes Pissarro: “Andy Warhol's revolutionary contributions to art history are often measured through his paintings, particularly their power, subject matter, technique and reception: huge canvases, immense personalities, gargantuan sums garnered at auction… What made his paintings so bold and new was, by contrast, the increasingly mechanistic techniques he used to create his compositions.
  
The exhibition is the largest collection of Warhol's work outside of the Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh
  Halcyon Gallery has successfully launched a landmark exhibition dedicated to the life and work of American pop artist and cultural icon Andy Warhol.","Arts & Entertainment

He must undergo a suitability review by both the Department of Justice and the New Hampshire Lottery Commission, the same government entities that investigated Sanborn’s use of COVID funds and found him unsuitable to be involved with charitable gaming.


Now, the former state senator Sanborn has no option but to sell the casino on South Main Street in Concord to a New Hampshire Lottery Commission-approved buyer within six months.
King’s decision left certain questions unanswered about a path back for Sanborn to operate one of the state’s 14 charitable gaming establishments or the future of a larger casino and event center on Loudon Road, which he and his wife State Rep. Laurie Sanborn got approved by the Concord Planning Board.


Sanborn managed to sidestep this restriction by masking the registered trade name “Concord Casino” on his application by utilizing the name “Win Win Win LLC” instead and categorized the business activity as “miscellaneous,” according to an investigation by the Attorney General’s Office and the Lottery Commission.","Law, Gov’t & Politics

""Before The Skivvies,"" Cearley recently told Playbill, ""I loved doing cabaret shows and concerts and doing very similar 'out there' musical arrangements, involving mash-ups and medleys that have a specific comedic angle to make you think of a song in a different way than you have heard them before.
Mientus co-starred with Cearley in the recent Chicago premiere of Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, and the two will share a Paul Williams song in homage of that production.


Actor-musician Cearley, who is currently playing his 10th engagement in Jonathan Tolins' comedy Buyer & Cellar (at New Orleans' Le Petit Theatre through February 3), will head to 54 Below February 9 at 7 PM for an evening titled I Didn't Recognize You with Your Clothes On.



Joined by a full band, led by pianist Lance Horne, the evening will mark Cearley's first solo show in over a decade.
And I think because The Skivvies are so nontraditional in the cabaret setting, I am trying to think out of the box to be, in fact, more traditional but still keep my edge that makes me 'me.'”



Cearley has been seen seen on Broadway in All Shook Up, while his Off-Broadway credits include A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Pageant, Sex Tips…, and Cupid & Psyche.","Arts & Entertainment

The exhibition uses creative collaboration and correspondence with Beard as a way to create a connection between Bacon and Warhol and a throughline between Three Times Out and Hugh Lane’s permanent exhibition.
I’m not surprised: it’s a mammoth exhibition, spanning decades and made up of about 250 pieces from the Andy Warhol Museum in Pennsylvania, the Estate of Peter Beard, and Hugh Lane’s own archive of Francis Bacon.

 Moving onwards, you pass through his Flowers series – a room almost exclusively dedicated to Warhol’s master-level command of colour – and his first piece featuring Elizabeth Taylor.
From here on out, Hugh Lane shows us series that warp and degrade, as this visual biography moves forwards to darker and more disturbed periods of Warhol’s creative life.","Arts & Entertainment

The artist, who works across sculpture, film, painting, installation and music, is known for his intensely personal, eclectic work, often involving cartoon representations of himself and an oscillation between irony and sincerity.
The suite of works is titled Structure of Feeling (2020) and has evolved as a sequel to the artist’s acclaimed Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape (2016), which was widely exhibited in international venues such as Tate Britain, MOCA Toronto, Glasgow International, Venice Biennale, Front International, and Future Generation Art Prize in Kiev.
In the hour-long animated film Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape, Holden presents his thesis that the world is now best understood as a cartoon, corresponding to physics and logic as depicted in early animations.
Deftly deploying a powerful vulnerability, Holden’s work takes these idiosyncratic starting points to reach towards larger abstract philosophical questions on the nature of memory and our universal striving to understand the visible and invisible structures that shape our world.","Arts & Entertainment

Writes Pissarro: ‘ Andy Warhol's revolutionary contributions to art history are often measured through his paintings, particularly their power, subject matter, technique and reception: huge canvases, immense personalities, gargantuan sums garnered at auction… What made his paintings so bold and new was, by contrast, the increasingly mechanistic techniques he used to create his compositions.'
  ‘As his paintings grew increasingly removed from the idea of individuality, he introduced new, cutting-edge elements to his prints.

Now Is the Time
  “We decided that now was the time to mine our collection to allow the public to see works that generally don't get highlighted,” said Gray, adding that there are 60 pieces in the Unseen exhibit, which are on display on the second floor of the museum.
A few lacked titles, so it took quite a bit of research within the collection for specifics,” said Gray, adding that he and other staff consulted with those within the Warhol world — those who knew and worked with him.
Gray said a portion of the exhibit is dedicated to some of Warhol's more explicit works.

“Warhol's seismic contribution to the story of art is that he tied his work to a collective consciousness more closely than any other artist had before,” says Kate Brown, Halcyon Gallery's creative director, who has curated the exhibition.
  
Both the silkscreen prints and the paintings will be displayed together in the UK for the first time at Halcyon Gallery, as part of its new major exhibition, Andy Warhol:
Andy Warhol's rarely seen original Ads paintings were created in 1985, as a set of ten painted canvases and a portfolio of prints.

His art is a pure reflection of popular culture in his lifetime and the spirit of western capitalism.""
  As Pissarro writes: ""Andy Warhol's revolutionary contributions to art history are often measured through his paintings, particularly their power, subject matter, technique and reception: huge canvases, immense personalities, gargantuan sums garnered at auction… What made his paintings so bold and new was, by contrast, the increasingly mechanistic techniques he used to create his compositions.
  
""Visitors will be given an overarching view of his entire career, including the chance to see many of his iconic portfolios in their entirety.
  ""Warhol's seismic contribution to the story of art is that he tied his work to a collective consciousness more closely than any other artist had before.
A new Warhol exhibition, Beyond the Brand , is opening in London, celebrating his unique and radical contribution to art history, and displaying many of his most iconic pieces from across his career; including rarely seen original paintings from his Ads series.
  
Bringing together his most iconic print portfolios, commercial work and rarely seen original canvases, Beyond the Brand will encompass the full range of Warhol's pictorial inventions and demonstrate the extraordinary power of his unique artistic vision.

Police say 32-year-old Harpreet Singh was attempting to steal seven pieces by artists including Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol.

 Despite the news, other art galleries nearby are not on high alert, saying with high-priced items come high-priced alarm systems.
Initial reports valued the pieces at $250,000, but the gallery director now believes it could’ve been a multi-million dollar heist.

While a catalogue raisonné had already been compiled by the German art historian Rainer Crone in 1970, Warhol’s death made possible the existence of an absolutely definitive list of his works: the Authentication Board was established to verify its contents.

  What was Andy Griffith's net worth and Salary?
  Table of Contents
  Drawing upon my specialized knowledge in celebrity net worth and its contextual implications, it's evident that Andy Griffith's financial legacy is both substantial and enduring.
His substantial financial legacy is a testament to his successful career, marked by iconic roles in television, particularly “The Andy Griffith Show” and “Matlock.”
Griffith's iconic status in American television history, primarily through his roles in “The Andy Griffith Show” and “Matlock,” played a pivotal role in this financial accomplishment.
Early Life
  Andy Samuel Griffith, born on June 1, 1926, in Mount Airy, North Carolina, emerged from humble beginnings that shaped his resilient character.
In his later years, Griffith featured in the film “Waitress” alongside Keri Russell, with his final leading role in the romantic comedy “Play the Game.”
  Political Life
  Griffith was presented with the chance to compete against Jesse Helms for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, but he opted not to pursue the opportunity.","Arts & Entertainment

His loans to the Hugh Lane Gallery include images of Mao, Monroe, Campbell's soup and the electric chair
 Walking through the Hugh Lane Gallery's ongoing Andy Warhol Three Times Out exhibition on Dublin's Parnell Square, one name – other than the artist's, of course – stands out: Jordan Schnitzer.
  He has donated 72 pieces of Warhol's work to the gallery for the exhibition, which includes more than 250 works borrowed from museums and private collections in the US, Canada, Europe and the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
Andy Warhol, I mean his images of Marilyn and Mao now are probably, with the Mona Lisa, the most-known art images in the world.”
  At 72 years old, Schnitzer has no plans to slow down.
So what happens is a museum, like the one in Dublin maybe called the Warhol foundation and said ‘boy, we'd like to borrow some work', and they said, ‘well call Jordan Schnitzer, he is there to serve', and we got the call and said ‘yes sir, yes ma'am, what do you need?
And why the special interest in Warhol?
  “Andy Warhol was, in our lifetime, probably the most foresighted artist of our time,” Schnitzer says, speaking about the artist's history, from Warhol's childhood in Pittsburgh to becoming a successful graphic artist in New York, to his legacy as an artist in Los Angeles and beyond.

of his work; an authentication board was established to protect the market from proliferating fakes.
Evidence overlooked by the board convinced Dorment that Simon's print was authentic; it had been rejected and mutilated, Dorment suspected, because it contradicted the foundation's preferred narrative about Warhol's technical methods during different periods of his career.
The board's judgments were issued by fiat, and in 2001 its experts ruled that a silk-screened self-portrait, which the American collector Joe Simon (also known as Joe Simon-Whelan) hoped to resell for $2m, had not been made by Warhol, even though it was stamped with his signature and inscribed by his business manager.
Although no blame attached to the foundation, changes were subsequently made to the way it handled Warhol's estate: the authentication board closed down and, as Dorment tartly puts it, an auction house was engaged to “flog tens of thousands of works to… punters online”.
No reason was given for the decision and, in frustration, Simon appealed for help to Richard Dorment, then the art critic of the Daily Telegraph.","Arts & Entertainment

In the exhibit “Tell Me A Story: A Collection from Ron & Una Brasch,” Brasch and his wife share 67 of their works, more than half of which are contemporary Cuban pieces mostly bought during trips to Cuba over the last 15 years.
The couple began traveling to Cuba in 2008 to visit the artists in their studios and buy directly from them, and now own about 70 pieces of Cuban art.
  
You see Ron in terms of collecting and his love of the work and the pursuit of getting these, but you also see the relationship he has with Cuban artists and how he wants to elevate them.”
  Some years see the Brasches purchasing up to 20 new pieces.
In addition to Cuban art, the exhibit features three other components: American artists, international artists and eight light sculptures, mostly by Cuban artists, including Duvier del Dago, a sculpture professor at Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana.

It is not surprising that the first collaboration orchestrated by Bischofberger between Basquiat and another artist was neither with Warhol nor Francesco Clemente, with whom the practice is most often associated, but with the dealer's own daughter Cora, who was then precisely 3 years old.
The dealer was all the more sensitive to this since, the same year, he had asked Warhol to think of works dedicated to children, which became the series of silkscreen and hand-painted compositions Toy Paintings and a children's book published in 1983 that was designed by the artist ( Andy Warhol's Children's Book, published by Galerie Bruno Bischofberger).
 
In 1982, Bischofberger offered Warhol that he could paint Basquiat's portrait in exchange for a painting by the latter: ""Do you really think he is such an important artist?"" asked the pope of pop art.
The New York Times , in particular, which, Bischofberger recalled, ""spoke of manipulations on the part of Warhol, who made Basquiat his mascot...""
  He added: ""Basquiat, who had hoped to gain notoriety from this exhibition and endorsement by the famous Warhol, was disappointed by the reviews and essentially decided to end his painting sessions at the Factory.""","Fine Art

In a case that spiraled around the hot-button issue of whether a derivative work of art is a mere copy or fully transformative, the court ruled that celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith should have earned a fee when the Andy Warhol Foundation licensed Orange Prince , a silkscreen print image of Prince, for use by Vanity Fair magazine.
  
In their 7-2 ruling, the court majority skirted the argument long swirling around Warhol's creations of whether Orange Prince stood alone as a work of art even though it was based on Goldsmith's photo.
  
An Andy Warhol print of the late pop star Prince violated the copyright of the photographer who took the original image, the US Supreme Court said on Thursday, May 18, in a ruling with important implications for the art market.
  
But after Prince died in 2016, Warhol's foundation licensed to Vanity Fair another image of the musician – the Orange Prince – made from the same Goldsmith photo.

The concept of fair use  When Goldsmith claimed copyright infringement, the Warhol Foundation refused to acknowledge her claims, invoking the doctrine of fair use, which allows an artist to create work from an existing piece, as long as the artist makes significant changes.
'An unfortunate precedent'  Can the Supreme Court's decision in the Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith case, which shatters the impunity of artists, disqualify an entire history of art created through borrowing and citing?
Another famous copyright case is that of French photographer Patrick Cariou, who lost an appeal in 2013 against American artist Richard Prince, whom he accused of appropriating his photos of Jamaican rastas in a series of works called ""Canal Zone"" without transforming them in any notable way.
 
""Goldsmith's original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a ruling that the art world was eagerly awaiting.

From left: Director Felix Chong, Tony Leung, and producer Ronald Wong (Photo: Shaw)
  Chong, 54, told Yahoo in separate interview, “I wrote the script in 2018… After the bosses (at production company Emperor Motion Pictures) agreed to finance it, I happened to be talking to Andy Lau and I thought, ‘It's been almost 20 years since Infernal Affairs .
Story continues
  Reuniting onscreen with Andy Lau after more than 20 years
  This movie also marks the first onscreen reunion of Hong Kong cinema heavyweights Leung and Lau since Infernal Affairs in 2002.
  
That could probably be why Hong Kong cinema legend Tony Leung only ever played the bad guy a few times in his decades-long illustrious career.
  
The Goldfinger follows the rise and fall of a billion-dollar company, founded by a criminal mastermind (Tony Leung), over the course of a 15-year investigation by an elite anti-corruption investigator ( Andy Lau ).","Arts & Entertainment

The Goldfinger marks the big-screen reunion of Leung and Lau 20 years after their last project together – the critically acclaimed Infernal Affairs crime trilogy (2002 to 2003), which Chong wrote the script for.
  Leung – whose recent films include Hollywood superhero blockbuster Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021), Hong Kong crime drama Where The Wind Blows (2022) and Chinese espionage thriller Hidden Blade (2023) – shared that the rapport he has with Lau was first built when they filmed the TVB series The Duke Of Mount Deer (1984).
  
Leung, 61, was drawn to The Goldfinger not just because Chong asked him to be on board and he was fascinated by the story about financial crimes, but also because Lau, 62, would be his co-star.
  
We were playing good friends in the drama, and we naturally became buddies in real life.”
  He added: “Our great chemistry also stemmed from the trust we have in each other from the years of working together.”
  The Goldfinger is reported to have a budget of HK$350 million (S$59.5 million), making it one of the most expensive films ever made in Hong Kong.
  
Set in the 1980s, The Goldfinger follows the rise and fall of a multibillion-dollar company and its chairman (Leung), who undergoes a 15-year investigation led by an elite anti-corruption investigator (Lau).

A 2019 survey by the Society for Human Resources Management found that 58% of people who quit a job due to culture cited bosses and managers as their main reason.
I wanted to ensure that I was applying to a company that valued their employees and wanted to be able to turn away from any red flags before I accepted an offer, so I told my eventual new manager about the stupid-people comment.

What does it mean to you to have completed Mr. Monk's Last Case , and why do you think the movie worked now and not back then?
  Andy Breckman: I did write a script or even two scripts that for various reasons, never went forward -- budget reasons or schedule reasons.

  Mr. Monk's Last Case is the Monk movie fans wanted, but the Peacock effort leans too hard into updating the TV show to a post-COVID world.
  
Some of the most entertaining moments in Mr. Monk's Last Case come from the Rick Eden character -- both on his own as a fun villain and in the way he plays off Monk.","Arts & Entertainment

“I’m really excited about the Warhol’s Pop District,” said Hayley Haldeman, who teaches graduate courses on museum operations at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.

“Museums are really thinking broadly about what their mission is,” said Haldeman, an attorney with Cohen & Grigsby and former executive director of Pittsburgh’s Mattress Factory Museum.
In June, Citizens Financial Group committed $350,000 to the Pop District, both toward the Warhol Academy and to support the District’s biggest public art project to date, a mural by acclaimed Pittsburgh-based artist Mikael Owunna, installed on the side of a building across from the museum.




All five directors were long-serving, and all resigned in the months just before or just after the museum launched the Pop District.

WESA interviewed several of the five directors who departed, along with other former Warhol staffers.
At the May 2022 event announcing the Pop District, speakers at the Warhol included Hillman Foundation president David K. Roger, who said the project suggested “the future of how museums are going to engage with communities in a very, very different way going forward.”","Arts & Entertainment

Andy Cohen was sitting front row at the music icon's show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, on Saturday, and she took the time to make some playful comments about his hit Bravo show, Watch What Happens Live
  “If you say one more bad thing about me on your show… you're gonna get in so much trouble,” Madonna, 65, said as she addressed Cohen according to footage captured by fans in the audience and shared on X (formerly Twitter).
  
The Bravo host, 55, was smiling and laughing as the “Vogue” singer engaged with him — and even playfully tossed some of her drink in his direction — as she said, “You little troublemaker queen.”
  Cohen mouthed “I love you” and pointed and applauded after the seven-time Grammy winner said her piece, and she continued her blockbuster show on the Celebration Tour
  Cohen is but the latest of a string of famous faces that have appeared during Madonna's slew of shows in Brooklyn over the last few days.
  
Madonna's U.S. leg of the Celebration Tour, which kicked off in Brooklyn last week, continues until April — with a few shows in Canada mixed in — and she concludes the leg with five shows in Mexico City.
  
Similar to Popper's appearance, Garner sat beside the singer and judged her backup dancer's choreography during “Like a Prayer.”
  With both of their hair done up in blond curls, the former Ozark star, 29, and Madonna bore an almost uncanny resemblance as they played out the skit and the actress tried to keep her cool.

Documentary footage of Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys’s first meeting at an exhibition opening in Düsseldorf in 1979 is perhaps more notable for its flashing cameras and gawking bystanders than what passes between the artists themselves.


Making a face: Warhol’s portraits of Beuys

Andy Warhol’s Joseph Beuys, 1980

When Warhol made his series of portraits of Beuys, he affirmed the German’s status as a living icon of art, using a Polaroid taken at their first meeting that captures the German artist’s clear-eyed intellectual seriousness.
Andy Warhol: The Joseph Beuys Portraits is at Thaddaeus Ropac, London, to 15 February
Yet while they never became close friends, the encounter led to Warhol depicting Beuys over and over, in what is considered his last great portrait series, a selection of which is going on show at Ropac’s London gallery.
The art dealer had interned with Beuys in 1982, working with him on his landmark 7000 Oaks project, planted throughout the city of Kassel, and the German artist introduced him to Warhol.

Belonging to the Reversal Series in which Warhol reproduced key subjects from across his wide-reaching body of work - including his iconic portraits of Marilyn Monroe, the Mona Lisa and Mao - in reverse, these reworkings of Beuys's portrait demonstrate the particular value that he placed on his depiction of the other artist within his oeuvre.
 
Despite the radical differences in their aesthetics and philosophical approaches to art, Warhol and Beuys shared an alchemical ability to render everyday objects and images unfamiliar through their practices, as well as an obsession with self-stylisation: Beuys was the shamanic artist whose mythical origins lay in his rescue from a plane crash by nomadic Tatars, while Warhol cultivated his public image as the 'Pope of Pop', instantly recognisable in his silver-blonde wig.
Warhol used his Polaroid Big Shot to capture the now-iconic image of Beuys dressed in his signature felt hat and fishing vest, which went on to serve as the source image for the series of screenprinted portraits made between 1980 and 1986.
 
Repeating Beuys's arresting gaze on different scales and in different formats, Warhol exercised his characteristically experimental approach to materials in the portraits.","Arts & Entertainment

The Tate Modern added: “The exhibition will be a rare opportunity to see extraordinary works from the YAGEO Foundation Collection, including paintings by Francis Bacon, Gerhard Richter and Peter Doig and photographs by Thomas Struth, Andreas Gursky and Hiroshi Sugimoto.

“Shown in dialogue with many recent additions to Tate’s collection including works by Lorna Simpson, John Currin, Laura Owens, Michael Armitage and Louise Lawler.”

Visitors to the Tate Modern will have “a rare opportunity” to see works by artists including Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and David Hockney in a new exhibition exploring the relationship between painting and photography.


The Tate Modern says that the exhibit “will unfold as an open-ended conversation between some of the greatest painters and photographers of recent generations” and consider “how the brush and the lens have been used to capture moments in time”.


On show are pieces such as Warhol’s iconic silkscreen prints and paintings by Picasso and Francis Bacon, alongside images captured by acclaimed photographers.

Warhol’s painting was held in the collection of Swiss art dealers Thomas and Doris Ammann and auctioned at The Christie’s in New York on Monday, 9 May.

Additional fees such as a buyer’s price gave it the final value of $195m. 
“Shot Sage Blue Marilyn is the absolute pinnacle of American pop,” Alex Rotter, the chairman of 20th and 21st Century art at Christie’s, said in a statement announcing the auction.
The painting, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, is one of the many paintings in the series Warhol made of Monroe after she died of a barbiturate overdose in 1962.
The painting was sold for a hammer price of $170m to US art dealer Larry Gagosian, according to Bloomberg.","Fine Art

The Lottery Commission’s lawyers outlined four grounds for the possible revocation of Sanborn’s casino license, including the fraudulent acquisition of $844,000 in COVID relief funds not intended for casinos; the misappropriation of those funds for personal expenses, including purchasing a Ferrari and two Porsches and calling them business-related; exceeding documented lease amounts with loan funds for rent; and the failure to uphold accurate financial records and internal controls.


CONCORD MONITOR – GEOFF FORESTER

In his absence, Andy Sanborn’s legal team defended his credibility during Monday’s hearing primarily by asserting the Lottery Commission accusations were based on a careless investigation that failed to present complete facts.


While Sanborn is in a legal battle with the Lottery Commission, his business, Concord Casino on Main Street in Concord shows no signs of slowing down.
“In New Hampshire, it is a privilege, not a right, to hold a gaming license.”

Sanborn stands to lose his gaming license and be barred from participating in the state’s charitable gaming business model based on the outcome of the hearing.","Home & Garden

The centre requested it after Mr Burnham’s October 2020 speech went viral and led to a new title being bestowed on the Labour stalwart: King of the North.
The coat worn by Mr Burnham was bought in the 2012 Boxing Day sales from House of Fraser in Manchester, he has said.

“It struck a note with people because it is a very working class jacket and it feels authentic [on Mr Burnham], and it was very much in stark contrast to the suits being worn in those Westminster briefings.”

“As a museum, we knew that it was important to collect the political story of Covid for future generations,” said Sam Jenkins, collections manager at the centre.","Accessories

Warhol's “Red Self-Portrait” silkscreen from a respected London art dealer for $195,000.
  
“Smith's large-scale manufacture of Warhol's work ended only when the printer died in 1989.”
  In 2007, Simon launched a $20 million antitrust suit against the Board and the Foundation, claiming that the latter sought to inflate the prices of works that were part of Warhol's estate.
  
“The two highly realistic Andy Warhol signatures were stamped facsimiles, not written in Warhol's own hand.”
  Simon and Dorment teamed up to determine the true authentication process behind Warhol's works.
  
Thirteen years later, he was set to sell the piece for $2 million when he hit an unexpected roadblock: the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board refused to authenticate the work, implying it was fake.
  
“Until she started her job at the Foundation, she had no serious knowledge of any aspect of Warhol's work.”
  “Five years later, she joined the Authentication Board, later admitting that once there, she learned as she went along.","Arts & Entertainment

(KTVZ) -- The High Desert Museum is opening a new, colorful exhibit this weekend, with a special connection to both pop culture and a half-century of efforts to save many species from extinction.

The High Desert Museum will be unveiling Andy Warhol's Endangered Species exhibit to the public Saturday,
  ""The gallery is vibrant, and Andy Warhol's work is just a joy,"" museum Executive Director Dana Whitelaw said Friday.
  
Whitelaw added, ""I hope that visitors leave with a greater attention to detail for some of these lesser-known species, that their populations are in decline.""
  The Endangered Species exhibit is open through April 7th of next year.
The Endangered Species exhibit at the museum will showcase 25 of Warhols's pieces in the gallery.
  
The collection includes his Endangered Species series, as well as Warhol's Skull series and his Vanishing Animals series, along with his well-known Marilyn Monroe works.

In July 2019, a federal district court judge ruled in favor of the Andy Warhol Foundation on its claim of fair use, finding that the Prince Series was “transformative” because Goldsmith's image depicted Prince as “not a comfortable person” while Warhol's portrayed him as an “iconic, larger than life figure.”
 Goldsmith said in court documents that she was unaware that the image was to be used by Warhol and that the artist would continue to use her photograph to create a total of 16 works, including paintings and drawings, known collectively as the Prince Series.
 Goldsmith's response states that the Andy Warhol Foundation's petition “mischaracterizes” precedents already established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit's opinion “to manufacture a circuit split that does not exist.”
 Vanity Fair then commissioned Warhol, the artist known best for appropriating images from pop culture such as Campbell's soup cans and portraits of Marilyn Monroe, to make a silk-screen print based on the photo of Prince, according to documents filed to the Supreme Court.","Copyright Infringement

On a website called the Museum of Forgeries, the group known as MSCHF says it bought a 1954 ballpoint pen sketch by the pop art master called “Fairies”, which it says is worth $20,000, made 999 exact copies of it and mixed the original in with them.
MSCHF has posted a video showing how the copies are made: a robotic arm with a pen makes the drawings, which are then put through an accelerated artificial aging process with light, heat, pressure and moisture.
MSCHF, a collective created in 2016 and based in Brooklyn, specializes in reappropriating works of art or commercial objects.
Then the Warhol Foundation seal and annotations in pencil are manually replicated, MSCHF member Kevin Wiesner said in an email to AFP.","Copyright Infringement

 Sotheby's said its modern evening auction of 19th and 20th century works, including by Pablo Picasso and Philip Guston, is its “most valuable” in the category in 15 years.
 Alex Rotter, head of 20th and 21st century art at Christie's, has called the portrait “the most significant 20th century painting to come to auction in a generation.”
 After selling the first batch of works from the Macklowe Collection — the most expensive to hit the market at $600 million — last fall, Sotheby's will auction the remaining 30 items when its sales open on May 16.
The current most expensive 20th century auctioned work is Picasso's “Women of Algiers,” which fetched $179.4 million in 2015.","Accessories

 Reliance Industries's Isha Ambani and art curator Lawrence Van Hagen have put together a first-of-its-kind exhibition on American Pop Art in South-East Asia, featuring Andy Warhol and other greats.
  
The first exhibit of its kind in India, and perhaps the largest collection of American Pop Art to be showcased in South-east Asia, the show has been curated by Lawrence Van Hagen, a 30-year-old London-based art advisor and curator, who the Gentleman's Journal called ‘The gallerist of the moment'.
Q. Why did you choose Pop Art and how do you think the city of Mumbai will connect with it?
  When we were discussing the various exhibitions or themes that would be relevant for the Indian audience, Pop Art was shortlisted after much consideration as it reflected Isha (Ambani's) vision of making art relevant and exciting for the youth.
  
It helped that the Pop Art movement includes some of the best-known artists today, including Andy Warhol, whose works collectively have not been displayed in Mumbai before.
The exhibition presents works by 12 of the biggest names in American Pop Art, including Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg, among others.

Summers rose to fame in the early 1980s as the guitarist with the multi-million record selling rock band The Police.
The Police were the No. 1 band of the time and dominated the music scene and the media in the 1980s with several number albums and singles including “Every Breath You Take,” “Roxanne,” “Don't Stand So Close to Me,” “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,” “Invisible Sun,” and “Message in a Bottle.”
Since his tenure with The Police, Summers has made 13 solo records, collaborated with many other musicians and toured the world as a solo artist.
The film “Can't Stand Losing You” was based on the book and saw its theatrical release in the United States by Cinema Libre in March 2015.

Now at New York City's Brant Foundation, the Basquiat x Warhol Exhibition revisits the creative collaboration of two of the art world's most famous talents.


Decades before Jigga claimed to be “the new Jean-Michel,” Basquiat formed a personal and professional relationship with Andy Warhol — the king of pop art most famous for his Campbell’s soup can paintings, multicolored silkscreen portraits and the prophetic phrase, “In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.”
The Basquiat x Warhol Exhibition at the Brant Foundation, recently opened in New York City’s East Village, presents dozens of collaborative paintings the two created from late 1983 to 1985.


Basquiat’s bromance with Warhol produced over 160 paintings, culled from and curated by Dr. Dieter Buchhart and Peter M. Brant (in collaboration with Dr. Anna Karina Hofbauer) for the new exhibit.
Warhol’s “Jean-Michel Basquiat” could qualify as his most striking work of the 1980s.","Arts & Entertainment

“And the works that she made then, if you view them now, they still feel very contemporary.”

The Deji Art Museum has high hopes for an exhibition that presents a contemporary and cross-cultural perspective on art – betting that it will draw visitors from near and far.


Deji Art Museum built up its collection – which comprises more than 10,000 works – over two decades, says the museum’s director, Ai Lin.
Many international visitors to Shanghai Art Week this month made the side trip to Nanjing to visit Deji and other private museums: Sifang Art Museum, G Museum and the latest, the Cloud Collection – Contemporary Art Centre.

Hosted by saxophonist/World Saving Sh*tshow correspondent Nick Gerlach, the nightly variety show will search for each city's most talented Frasco fans.While the Big Easy would undoubtedly offer a bevy of talent-especially during Jazz Fest-Frasco has already found his talented opening act in Karina Rykman.
For Frasco's show during Jazz Fest that will be undoubtedly cathartic and joyous, he could find no better cosmic partner than the buoyant bassist.Frasco & The U.N. with Rykman at The Fillmore is the second show to be announced as part of Live For Live Music's 2021 Fest By Nite series.","Music

In the Warhol case, the trial court judge agreed with the Warhol Foundation, holding that the Prince series was fair use, in large part because it transformed the original Goldsmith work to give it a new meaning.
Though it is not the only element in evaluating fair use, the transformativeness concept has come to occupy a central place in legal analysis.In fact, shortly after the Second Circuit’s decision in the Warhol case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the importance of transformativeness when it held that Google’s unauthorized use in its Android operating system of 11,500 lines of code from Oracle’s Java SE program was transformative enough to qualify as fair use.Such use, the Supreme Court stated in Google v. Oracle, “adds something new and important,” typically by shifting the original work’s purpose, meaning, or message—and, as a consequence, stimulates creativity.
Was it fair to say that Google’s use of 11,500 lines of code to make a new operating system was transformative but Andy Warhol’s use of Goldsmith’s photo to make Orange Prince was not?In a sense, the Supreme Court in Google v. Oracle had an easier job than the Second Circuit did in Goldsmith v. Warhol.
How is a court to determine whether Warhol’s use of the photograph changed its purpose, meaning, or message?The Second Circuit argued that while it may have been Goldsmith’s intent to portray Prince as a vulnerable young artist, and Warhol’s “to strip Prince of that humanity and instead display him as a popular icon,” whether a work is transformative cannot depend merely on the artist’s intent.Rather, for Warhol’s work to be transformative, “it must reasonably be perceived as embodying an entirely distinct artistic purpose, one that conveys ‘new meaning or message’ entirely separate from its source material.”","Copyright Infringement

“The ornaments are made by a local artist that used to sell his work from All Things Chic, which was on Bank Street.

"2021-04-30T00:54:49+0000",Hackernoon,"https://hackernoon.com/from-warhol-to-nfts-the-evolution-of-digital-art-c32434rt","From Warhol to NFTs: The Evolution of Digital Art","In 2021, however, the phrase “digital art” conjures up an image of something seemingly unrelated and totally extraneous to art, whether rendered by brush or mouse; cryptocurrencies.A cursory glance at the headlines littering the shelves of any newsagent from San Francisco to Singapore should suffice to explain why this is; Mike Winklemann, better known by his alias Beeple, became the third most valuable living artist in the world earlier in March with the sale of his digital artwork Everydays at Christie’s for $69 million.Beeple sold the artwork as a “non-fungible token” or NFT; a one-of-a-kind entry on a blockchain ledger which cannot be duplicated, and which has a wholly unique value and virtual entity.
NFTs address this problem as they are, by their nature, impervious to forgery, and their blockchain ledger provides an immutable and traceable provenance and record of ownership.It’s important to note that this benefit isn’t just limited to digital artworks or digital assets; NFTs can also serve as proxies for physical assets, and their benefits are equally applicable to the tangible as they are to the intangible.
By creating an NFT based on and linked to a physical asset, such as a luxury consumer good or a work of art, that physical asset would be perfectly traceable and verifiable on the blockchain, and the NFT would serve as a de facto contract and proof of ownership.However, the very quality which gives NFTs their value, which makes them innovative, and which has undoubtedly been the cause of their meteoric rise, may also prove to be their biggest hindrance; namely, indivisibility.
Fractional ownership is a concept and a process whereby a whole physical asset is digitised in the form of a single NFT, and that NFT is subsequently tokenized into any given number of fungible, indistinct, and comparable contracts or tokens.Returning to the example of the Mona Lisa, through fractional ownership the French Government, being the owners of the artwork, could create an NFT based on it, and then tokenize that NFT into any given number of simpler, fungible tokens representing an equal and transferable portion of ownership.
The adoption and implementation of fractional ownership across the industry would go a long way in democratising the world of art, and would bring it within reach of the widest possible community.Should this widespread adoption occur, there’s no doubt posterity will attribute this evolution in the art world to the revolution caused by NFTs; NFTs paved the way for fractional ownership through the paradigm shift they caused in the way people think about what constitutes a work of art, and as such both NFTs and the fractional ownership concept can be regarded as instrumental in shaping both the history and the future of art.","Fine Art

The film is based on Edward Gorey’s book of the same name that was published in 1957.
The description of the book reads:
The doubtful guest shows up unannounced and unwelcome, yet its presence is accepted after only a brief interlude of screaming.
The staid, pale, Victorian inhabitants of the mansion alternately stare and glare at the doubtful guest as it tears out whole chapters from books, peels the soles of its white canvas shoes, and broods while lying on the floor (""inconveniently close to the drawing-room door"").
Strangely, or rather, typically, as this is a Gorey book, the stymied occupants never ask the guest to leave--and in 17 years it has still ""shown no intention of going away.""","Books & Literature

A New Museum Show Says Faith Played a Key Role in His Work","Andy Warhol is synonymous with Pop art and celebrity, Campbell’s Soup and Marilyn Monroe—but one driving force in the artist’s work that people may not know about is Warhol’s relationship to Catholicism.A new exhibition illuminating the ways Catholic themes appear in Warhol’s work will travel to the Brooklyn Museum this fall from Pittsburgh’s Andy Warhol Museum.
“It’s not something I knew about Warhol, or that I think that most folks knew,” Brooklyn Museum curator Carmen Hermo, who organized the upcoming presentation, titled “ Andy Warhol: Revelation,” told Artnet News.
For a 1984 commission from dealer Alexander Iolas—who gave Warhol his first show, in 1952—the artist made more than 100 “Last Supper Works,” including prints, hand-painted drawings, and large-scale silk screen paintings, two of which will be on view in the exhibition.That includes the copy from the Baltimore Museum of Art, where controversial plans to auction the work were jettisoned after a widespread outcry.
The piece is one of more than 30 works being added to the show for its Brooklyn iteration, including Warhol’s famous 1966 film The Chelsea Girls.
“There’s no key passage in Warhol’s diary that says, ‘I’m struggling with my faith as a Catholic and a gay man,'” Hermo said, “but when you see the artwork and you see the gestures of Jesus and his disciples, when there are paintings bringing together a bodybuilder’s form in the loving arms of Christ, you see allusions to the two [opposing forces] existing in one person, one artist.","Fine Art

One landmark museum show gathers masterworks from his early experimentations with the silkscreen process through the peak of his fame, on loan through the Bank of America Art in our Communities® program, and will reach a Long Island audience, including thousands of schoolchildren in local districts, who have never before had a local museum show dedicated to Andy Warhol.As Angela S. Anton, president of the Museum’s board of trustees, comments, “We are absolutely thrilled to partner with the Bank of America, a longtime generous supporter of our education and exhibition efforts, on this fabulous show.”
He seized the powerful tools of media and advertising right then in his own moment and, with an artistic alchemy that never fails to astonish, he returned the Campbell’s soup can to the supermarket aisle with the new aura of an artistic masterpiece.Andy Warhol, Campbell’s Soup II: New England Clam Chowder, 1969, screenprint on paper, 13/250 Courtesy of the Bank of America Collection and the Bank of America Art in our Communities Program © 2021 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. / Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New YorkPublicity shots of celebrities, including Muhammad Ali and Albert Einstein, radiate the colorful energy of icons.
This show, which will offer valuable lessons for thousands of school children as well as the general public, offers an historically important opportunity to teach a new generation about the importance of Warhol, and to open those who may be familiar with many of his works to a brand-new interpretation of a familiar figure.Even in person, Andy Warhol was an otherworldly presence whose rapid-fire production and mass-media ubiquity left an impression of distance, the way the celebrities he portrayed seemed to come from another world.This air of mystery pervades one of the most haunting works in the show, a self-portrait titled The Shadow.
This is an opportunity to become acquainted with a more personal genius, in part through the intimacy of his magazine and record album designs (precious archival materials), his hand-colored flowers and some of his earliest interpretations of the Campbell’s Soup can and Marilyn Monroe portrait.The portfolios reveal the process that Warhol perfected, and the Museum installation will follow his grid format in the presentation of the series.","Fine Art

“Pop Art is for everyone,” Warhol famously said.Warhol was also the author of the classic 15 Minutes of Fame celebrity phenomena (which many are living to this day through social media), and he used many unusual elements as part of his work.
One of his muses was a can of Campbell’s soup, which helped create his legendary “32 Campbell’s Soup Cans,” piece which solidified his influential philosophy.Word is this piece was one of his all-time favourites.This year marks the 60th anniversary of Warhol’s ode to Campbell’s Soup, and to celebrate, Campbell Canada has partnered with The Andy Warhol Foundation to release limited edition Warhol-inspired soup cans available across Canada, as well as encouraging future artists to follow in his footsteps: Campbell Canada has challenged several Canadian artists and influential content creators, to find colourful, everyday inspiration from the limited edition cans and produce their own version of pop art-inspired content.
Each creator will release their original pop art creations inspired by the cans on their social media channels this month with the hashtag #CampbellsxWarhol.
A digital art gallery hosted by Refinery29 will be home to a selection of the unique works produced from the campaign.","Fine Art

Fairbanks, who interviewed the families of the men along with other local fishermen, weaves in a story of Montauk’s changing demographics as it shifted from “a drinking town with a fishing problem” to a hot spot for the wealthy.Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment, by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R Sunstein (Little, Brown Spark, 18 May): What might cause a doctor to give different diagnoses to patients with the same symptoms?

The four fair use factors are (1) purpose and character of the use (2) the nature of the copyrighted work (3) the amount and substantiality of use (4) the effect of the use on the market for the original.In evaluating the first of these factors, the Second Circuit said its chief concern was whether the Prince Series was sufficiently “transformative.”
Was Warhol’s iconic process of silk-screening, flattening a photograph, and adding bold colors, sufficiently transformative of the original photograph to be considered fair use?Reviewing similar cases, the Second Circuit noted that, “where a secondary work does not obviously comment on or relate back to the original or use the original for a purpose other than that for which it was created, the bare assertion of a ‘higher or different artistic use’... is insufficient to render a work transformative.”
When the defense was at its most expansive, the Second Circuit held in Cariou v. Prince (2008 ) that if a resulting work had “a different character” and “employ[ed] new aesthetics with creative and communicative results” it constituted fair use, even if it had not been designed to make any sort of comment about the original work.The Second Circuit acknowledged in the Warhol case that Cariou was a “high-water mark” but had “not been immune from criticism.”
Conceivably, the Supreme Court’s view of the transformative nature of Google’s operating system will cause the Second Circuit to reconsider its opinion that the Warhol paintings were not sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use.","Copyright Infringement

I hope this technology will not only turn more people into collectors, but make this world a bit nicer place to live.Because of NFTs art can become more interactive right now.
With NFT technology all these things become possible — it is a new medium for experimentation for artists.Global aspect.
But it is not about that -NFT is a new canvas, new medium, but art is still about ideas and imagination — only these things are really important.How do you think NFTs have the potential to help society in the future?NFTs will make art more accessible to normal people.
Bring fresh ideas — Adding to conversation, not just repeating somebody’s else thoughts or approachesExperiment — Be brave — try new things and don’t afraid to fail hardKnow your medium well — Blockchain technology is the basis for NFTs, if you know how it works, its strengths and weaknesses, you can create many more thingsCollaborate — NFTs came from startup/silicon valley culture that knows, and collaboration is more powerful than competitionCommunicate — In the NFT space there are no middlemen — no galleries and art advisors.","Fine Art

Andy Burnham winning the Greater Manchester mayoral election in a landslide victory this week was one of the few success stories for the Labour party in England.
Labour retained control of Manchester City Council but in Bolton, the Conservative party leapfrogged the Labour party to become the largest political force in the borough.
Now, betting companies are now stating that Andy Burnham is the most likely person to become the next leader of the Labour party.
PaddyPower is giving 5/2 odds for Burnham becoming the next party leader, with London mayor Sadiq Khan his closest contender.","Politics

Bringing a new perspective to Warhol’s work, Revelation examines his life-long engagement with Catholicism and the tension between the doctrines of religion and his life as an out gay man moving in such eccentric and iconoclastic circles.
“Warhol both flaunted and obscured his religion and his sexuality, and these dualities are explored in Revelation along with the push and pull between sincerity and superficiality, revealing and hiding, traditional and avant-garde,” says Carmen Hermo, Associate Curator of the Brooklyn Museum.
A statement from the Brooklyn Museum says, “Even after legendary parties at his studio, the Silver Factory, Warhol returned to the quiet home he shared with his mother, who prayed with him every morning before he left for another day of prolific, history-making work.”

Subscribe here to Disney Plus Since before the release of Venom – 35% there were doubts about the possibility that the character played by Tom Hardy could ever meet Spider-Man played by Tom Holland; rumors said the latter would have a cameo and before that producer Amy Pascal had suggested that Venom it was part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When released Venom It was clear that it was a different universe, but later came the trailer for Morbius, a film that, as far as we know, does belong to the same universe as Venom, but had two very explicit references to Spider-Man; on the one hand they showed him in a mural on the street, and on the other hand Michael Keaton appeared, who gave life to Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming – 92%.
Some theorize that it will be across the multiverse in Spider-Man: No Way Home, but so far nothing is certain except what the director of Venom: Let there be Carnage Andy Serkis , in an interview with IGN (via Digital Spy): Also read: Morbius premiere delayed again His last words seem to advance that there are plans for the future, and as already said before, they are not a secret; the trailer of Morbius showed that there will be a connection to the MCU, we just can't know yet which way it will be addressed.
The previous film of Venom It was directed by Ruben Fleischer and although it did not get a majority of positive reviews, it was a box office success; the sequel was left in the hands of Andy Serkis , director of A Reason To Live – 67% and Mowgli: Tales from the Jungle Book – 48%, but best known for having given life to several computer-generated characters with the motion capture technique, Gollum by The Lord of the rings Y The Hobbit ; Caesar, from Planet of the Apes ; and Snoke, from the sequel trilogy of Star wars Superheroes (and antiheroes) enjoy enormous popularity, first in comics and television, and in movies in the last two decades.","Movies

Instead of multiple shows staged at various points throughout the summer, Andy’s is making its return to live theater with just one show and it will be unlike anything they’ve ever embarked on before.Instead of having the audience gather in the barn for a staged show, they will be outside in a drive-in style – but the performers will be inside.
And what is the title of Andy’s lone summer performance you might ask?
Well, that’s to be determined.The entire summer is billed as Andy’s Summer Playhouse 2021: WE ARE… and what that means will happen within the walls of Andy’s between July 12 and Aug. 20.
Enrollment opens May 19.In-person orientations at Andy’s, 582 Isaac Frye Highway, Wilton, are scheduled for Sunday, June 13 and Sunday, June 27, with times to be determined.A $100 registration fee gives each child, 8 to 18 years old, full access to all of the summer programming, and there will be no tuition fee this summer.","Music

“This silkscreen was given to me during some crazy years and I had completely forgotten I even owned it,” Cooper said Thursday during a press conference.Scottsdale’s Larsen Gallery will conduct the auction Oct. 23, with some of the proceeds going to Cooper’s Solid Rock foundation, which supports Valley teens interested in music, art, dance, sound and video.The piece has an estimated value of $2.5 million to $4.5 million and could become the most expensive painting ever sold in Arizona, according to the gallery.With Cooper’s shock rock persona, it’s no surprise that the Warhol work has a macabre side to it.The acrylic and silkscreen on 22.5-inch-by-28-inch canvas piece, titled “Little Electric Chair,” is from the iconic pop artist’s 1964-65 “Death and Disaster” series.The red and black image is based on a photo from the chamber where convicted spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in in 1953.
Cooper used to incorporate an electric chair into his extravagant stage shows.
“I went through the garage and went through all these tubes and pulled it out, and it was in perfect condition,” Cooper said.Cooper said he’s selling it because although he collects art, mainly from local artists, he doesn’t collect Warhol.

But there's one character who doesn't get nearly as much airtime as she should: Pat Ast, the model and actress who hung around both the Halston and Warhol gangs in the 1960s and ‘70s.
Halston and Pat Halston noticed Ast early on in the Fire Island days, and was so taken with her that he offered her a job at his Madison Avenue boutique.
Ast also appeared on Halston's runways, and was a major fixture in the group lovingly dubbed by André Leon Talley “The Halstonettes”—models and socialites like Pat Cleveland and Anjelica Huston.
“And I love it, every minute of it,” she once told the Los Angeles Times Life in Los Angeles In 1975, Ast moved from New York City to Los Angeles in more serious pursuit of her acting career.","Movies

Oracle, Goldsmith told the court in a brief.3 minute readThe Google logo is displayed outside the company offices in New York, U.S., June 4, 2019.
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling for photographer Lynn Goldsmith in a dispute over Andy Warhol’s appropriation of her photo of Prince is compatible with the U.S. Supreme Court’s April ruling in Google v. Oracle, Goldsmith told the court in a brief.In acourt-ordered Thursday briefon the impact of the Supreme Court's decision, Goldsmith argued Google v. Oracle was ""irrelevant to how this Court applied the flexible fair-use factors to a fundamentally different type of copyrighted work.
The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts sued in 2017 to clear Warhol from potential infringement claims, and Goldsmith countersued for infringement.Reversing Manhattan District Judge John Koeltl, a three-judge panel led by U.S. Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch found on March 26that Warhol's works weren't protected by the fair use doctrine largely because they weren't transformative.A transformative work must have a ""fundamentally different new artistic purpose and character,"" Lynch said, which must be ""something more than the imposition of another artist's style"" that ""remains both recognizably deriving from, and retaining the essential elements of, its source material.
headtopics.comThe foundation also said that the high court cited a ""Warhol-like work of art"" — a painting that ""precisely replicates"" an advertising logo to comment on consumerism, like Warhol's Campbell's soup cans — as a ""paradigm example"" of transformative use.Goldsmith, represented by Thomas Hentoff and Lisa Blatt of Williams & Connolly, responded that the Supreme Court's decision emphasized that fair use is a case-specific analysis, and that its ruling would have ""limited application outside the context of computer code.
""That Warhol created an arguably transformative work in the Campbell’s soup paintings does not suggest that his entire body of work is entitled to that designation,"" Goldsmith said.The case is Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc v. Goldsmith, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, No. 19-2420.","Copyright Infringement

The painting, which was created as part of Warhol’s ‘Death And Disaster’ series between 1964-65, is named Little Electric Chair, and is based on a 1950s photo of the death chamber at the Sing Sing prison in Ossining, ‎New York.Explaining how he found his painting, he said: “One day a few years ago, I was talking to Dennis Hopper who said he was selling a couple of his Warhols.
“All it really did with me was it knocked me out,” Cooper told Good Day Rochester in a new interview.
A new lullaby album of Alice Cooper songs for infants was also released last month.
The album was released in partnership with Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star, the company which creates “beautiful lullaby versions of your favourite artists”, via Roma Music Group.The post Alice Cooper is selling his rare Andy Warhol painting appeared first on NME.Source : Will Richards LinkΠηγήΡεπορτάζ: e-Radio.","Fine Art

The work of the master of pop art dating from 1964 is a screenprint titled ""Little Electric Chair"" from the series ""Death and Disaster"" and it was a gift that Copper received and kept it in storage.
According to Cooper, his artistic tastes are different today, his house is decorated with some motel signs and with aesthetics that evokes Arizona, so Warhol's work does not ""fit"" with his current tastes.
The screenprint that was already authenticated by Richard Polsky was displayed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 Cleveland, Ohio and is now open to the world market to be acquired through auction at Larsen Art Auction.
Larsen Art Auction reported that there are between 50 and 55 known ""Little Electric Chairs"" in a variety of colors, such as blue, green and yellow.","Fine Art

Pop art and graffiti maestros such as Futura, Fab 5 Freddy, Rammellzee, Warhol and Madonna covered the fridge door with “a cacophony of signatures, tags and designs covering every inch of this both ordinary and extraordinary item,” notes the statement.

However, the approach hasn’t gone down well with Williams, who feels that Instagram wants to leverage NFT artists' insights to provide market research for the development of an NFT platform of its own.
Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, has partnered with rendering software providers RNDR, and its parent company OTOY to create holographic NFTs.
Beeple will help the platform create a new form of holographic NFTs, along with minting his entire catalog on RNDR’s network.

In 2019, The Andy Warhol Museum produced a video that details the complicated and impressive process.After the landmark success of Christie’s sale of Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS: The First 5000 Days” earlier this year, The Andy Warhol Foundation identified the early digital works as ideal candidates for the emerging medium of NFT art.
“The sale of these original works from a watershed moment in the history of digital art will generously provide funds to support the philanthropic organization established by Warhol in furtherance of the Foundation’s mission to advance the visual arts.
As the great visionary of the 20th century who predicted so many universal truths about art, fame, commerce, and technology, Warhol is the ideal artist and NFTs are the ideal medium to re-introduce his pioneering digital artworks through this special dedicated sale at Christie’s.”
Allison Immergut, Junior Specialist, Post-War & Contemporary Art at Christie’s, said, “Christie’s is honored to continue our long-standing partnership with The Andy Warhol Foundation and to bring these five digital drawings to market for the first time since their creation in the mid-1980s.","Fine Art

“That was because Warhol had such an early version of the computer—they literally gave him serial number two or something like that,” Levin said.To read those images today, the Computer Club converted the files first to PPM, or portable pixmap format, and then to the modern PNG format.
“If Christie’s were incredibly orthodox about it, they would actually be offering the unreadable Amiga file—you’ll get the hash of the Amiga file, and you’ll get a PNG of the original image so you can see what it looks like, and you’ll get a high resolution version that you can use as an exhibition copy, and we’ll throw in an Amiga monitor so you can display it exactly the way that Warhol would have seen it.”
The Warhol Foundation denies that it asked the Computer Club to create high resolution exhibition copies of the artworks, and argues that by its very nature, an NFT sale cannot offer the original file.
“The original drawings are not for sale; each of the five NFTs points to a restored and preserved file, which retains all of the artistry of Warhol’s Amiga compositions in a digital file format that can be accessed by modern computers,” Michael Dayton Hermann, the foundation’s director of licensing, marketing, and sales, told Artnet News.","Technology & Computing

But as Golan Levin , Director of the Studio for Creative Inquiry, explained on Wednesday via Twitter , Christie's newest NFT auction isn't technically selling Warhol's recovered Amiga files, but essentially “altered, 2nd-generation near-copies” of each digital rendering, a detail could easily be overlooked by potential bidders, especially after reading Christie's aggrandizing PR for the lot.
Digital exhibition copies ‘at best' — Speaking via email, Levin told Input that, in his opinion, “what's being offered in the Christie's sale could best be described as (upscaled) ‘exhibition copies' that the Warhol Foundation asked our team to produce from the original files.”
“For this reason, in my opinion, I believe it is not accurate to say that the buyer is getting an ‘original,' especially given the emphasis that Christie's CEO has placed on ‘the possibility to secure the uniqueness and the authenticity of this work on the blockchain,'” he adds, referring to Guillaume Cerutti's description of the auction during a recent interview with CNN Christie's responds to confusion — In an official statement provided to Input by Christie's and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts , the auction house writes: Each of the five unique NFTs offered in the current sale at Christie's points to a restored and preserved file, which retains all of the artistry of Warhol's Amiga compositions.
- Michael Dayton Hermann, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Treating digital art as a legitimate medium, not a cash grab — What's particularly strange about Christie's latest digital art controversy is that it could have easily been avoided, or at least properly clarified for potential buyers.","Copyright Infringement

Considering the condition and unassailable provenance of this piece, we’d say that it’s actually a rather good deal, even at the higher end of that estimate.When it comes to watches, Warhol is perhaps best known for his love of the Cartier Tank Louis, about which he famously quipped “I don’t wear a Tank watch to tell the time.

The exhibit features 120 images, many of which have never been seen before and include polaroid collages, 16mm film screen tests, unique gelatin silver prints, and Polaroids of Warhol's many famous friends.
This exhibition provides a scintillating introspective, especially as I consider these lesser-known stitched photos as an extension of Warhol's raw self, one that the public has scarcely seen.
“This exhibition was created to underscore who Warhol was as a person, an artist, and an experimenter through his photography, and to delve into the stories and subjects behind the surface of his iconic images - beyond those instant moments,” says Fotografiska Exhibitions Manager Grace Noh.

Daddy's Home is soaked in late night 1970s New York references, drawing inspiration not only from Candy Darling's extraordinary life, but also the thrill and ultimate reward of creating your own reality.
“Candy Darling, to me, epitomises the New York dream,” Clark says, while driving and chatting on the phone in Los Angeles, where she's been living since completing the album.
Almost 15 years since releasing the debut St Vincent album Marry Me , Clark feels “extraordinarily lucky” to be six albums into a solo career that followed her role as a touring member of Sufjan Stevens' band.
Clark's fascination with the late-night glamour and temptations of New York in the '70s bring a big whiff of nostalgia to Daddy's Home .","Music

Based on groundbreaking research, the innovative show brings together Warhol’s classic paintings, prints, and drawings with his films and photography.Structured into five sections, the exhibition crafts a non-linear narrative that begins with a focus on Warhol’s early work, archival material, and historical photographs, underlining the influence of his youth in Pittsburgh on his practice as a whole, and marking the first time an approach of this depth has been featured in a solo exhibition for the artist outside of The Andy Warhol Museum.This exhibition is curated by Jose Carlos Diaz and Patrick Moore, Chief Curator and Director of The Andy Warhol Museum, respectively, and will subsequently travel to UCCA Edge (Shanghai) after appearing at UCCA.
Below, Moore and Philip Tinari, Director of UCCA, discuss Warhol’s enduring impact on youth culture, Chinese contemporary art, and cultural diplomacy.Patrick Moore, Director, The Andy Warhol Museum: Phil, when you first visited The Warhol several years ago to discuss a possible project, I was impressed that you spoke about your interest in lesser-known aspects of Warhol’s work.
Image: The Andy Warhol MuseumPhilip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art: H onestly, I think the basic understanding of Warhol in China is probably somewhat similar to what it is in the US and elsewhere: people know those iconic works, and maybe the concept of Pop, but they don’t necessarily understand the depth and diversity of the larger practice.
One thing we have been trying to do at UCCA in recent years — in addition to the exhibitions of key living Chinese and international artists that have been our mainstay since the beginning — is to bring art history to life for audiences in China by confronting them with comprehensive exhibitions of works by major figures who have laid the groundwork for our contemporary moment.Add to that how the idea of commercial “crossovers” has become so key to this younger generation’s understanding of fashion and culture in China these last few years, and Warhol — both the early commercial artist and the late cultural icon — becomes more relevant than ever.","Fine Art

Andy Warhol: Photo Factory is the largest west coast exhibition of Warhol photography to date, with many of the images kept in a private collection until now.Curated and produced with international photography museum Fotografiska, Hedges Projects and Jack Shainman Gallery, the exhibition will preview at NeueHouse Hollywood before traveling to Fotografiska New York this Fall, and on to Fotografiska Stockholm and Tallinn in 2022 and 2023.
“This exhibition was created to underscore who Warhol was as a person, an artist, and an experimenter through his photography, and to delve into the stories and subjects behind the surface of his iconic images – beyond those instant moments,” says Fotografiska Exhibitions Manager Grace Noh.All six categories of Warhol’s film-based work are spectacularly represented, including his famousPolaroids of celebrities, artists and friends such as Debbie Harry, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Dolly Parton, Grace Jones, and Keith Haring; lesser seen unique gelatin silver prints in which the artist photographed his creative process, friends and surroundings, including hotel lobbies, room service trays, and other inanimate objects that painstakingly documented his social environs; Polaroid collages created for publications such as Vogue Paris and Mondo Uomo; 16mm film Screen Tests from the mid-1960s; photo booth strips taken in Times Square in the 60s; and his most recent stitched photographs series, his final body of work exhibited before his death in 1987.
The fact is, Warhol used a camera as part of his daily social interactions over the course of four decades, it was integral to his interactions and his art-making process.Notably, Warhol’s earliest photographic works will be presented, offering a glimpse into his experimentation with the medium and how it served as a catalyst for his early silkscreen paintings, commissioned portraits, and commercial work.A key highlight of the exhibition is the collection of stitched photographs, in which Warhol physically sewed together prints in consecutive grids of 4, 6 and 12 images, incorporating his characteristic use of repetition.
These short, black-and-white film portraits display close-up and intimate shots of subjects from New York’s cultural scene at the time, underlining Warhol’s fascination with photography and the practice of capturing successive moments in time.The text for Andy Warhol: Photo Factory is authored by curator, writer, and photography critic, Vince Aletti, who shares –Warhol was as restless as he was relentless and shortly after he took up film, he picked up his own cameras: Polaroids and nifty little point-and-shoots.","Fine Art

While his yards per attempt of 4.0 was just a tick off his career average of 4.1, it is understandable why Bell grew frustrated playing for Reid.

It is a rare stroke of good fortune to be able to see how Warhol surfed through all six film-based categories, found source material for prints and paintings etcetera, and, ultimately, a formal body of work – the stitched photographs, which showcased the lasting relevance of contemporary photography.
In the 1960s, Warhol’s work expanded by using tools such as a 16mm film camera and the Times Square photo booth in order to capture new visions of his subjects, thereby removing the hand of the artist and creating through a machine – something Warhol adopted for the remainder of his career.
James R. Hedges, IV: Drawing on the body of work created with the 35mm camera, Warhol began to select images that he wanted to use as the basis for more formal, process-oriented, almost sculptural works – his stitched photographs.
James R. Hedges, IV: My initial interest and attraction to Warhol’s work stem from my exposure to Interview Magazine as a young man longing to learn about life in New York City.","Fine Art

The exhibition features over 114 engaging and powerful works created since the birth of Pop over a half-century ago, and includes works by noted celebrity Neo-Pop artists such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Takashi Murakami.
Demonstrating its broad contemporary appeal in this latest crop of Pop practitioners, the Pop aesthetic is as popular today as it was in the 1960s, and taken overall, Pop Power underscores the draw Pop has on the contemporary imagination.This cross-historical survey of Pop and Neo-Pop art presented in POP Power from Warhol to Koons was made possible through a collaboration with Jordan D. Schnitzer and the Jordan Schnitzer Family Foundation.
The exhibition features many recent and important acquisitions by collector Jordan D. Schnitzer including significant works by Koons, Murakami, and others, and was curated by the late Patrick Shaw Cable, PhD, Deputy Director of Exhibitions and Education of the Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia.Schnitzer and Figge Executive Director Michelle Hargrave will introduce the exhibition to the general public in an opening celebration on June 24 at 6:30 p.m., while Figge members are invited to celebrate the opening of POP Power from Warhol to Koons with a tour given by Jordan Schnitzer and his team – and complimentary light refreshments at the bar – at 5:15 p.m. on June 25.

With its 45-year history of producing nationally renowned theatre, the Playhouse continues to fill a unique theatre and arts education role in the city, state and greater metropolitan region.Beginning with the 2019-20 Season, George Street Playhouse moved to the New Brunswick Performing Arts Center in downtown New Brunswick.

Zimmerman also noted that the city has to reallocate funds from elsewhere in its budget to fund this particular grant.According to a 2015 document on the city’s website, urban development investment grants are allocated for “development and redevelopment projects in downtown, reinvestment areas, reinvestment corridors, corporate parks and long-term vacant big box shells that have requested city participation.”
Stu Nichols, one of Zimmerman’s partners on the project, explained during the city council meeting that they wouldn’t touch the $250,000 from the city until they were able to fill the gap that they currently face to fund the project.
During the May 18 city council meeting, both Notes for Notes and a representative for Guilford County Schools wrote letters in support of Zimmerman’s project.Joseph Wilkerson III, another arts organizer in Greensboro, had mixed feelings about the fact that Zimmerman got $250,000 from the city for his project.Wilkerson, who is the executive director of Uptown GSO Inc., echoed Zimmerman’s assertion that the grants are available to anyone, but also noted that people need to know they exist to actually apply for them.
Wilkerson said that he would have used the money to get a space for entrepreneurs to start businesses.Neither of them have $2 million up front to bring to city council for a grant like the one Zimmerman got, they","Apartments

With four films from Warhol's private Screen Tests series— Archie and George with Coca Cola, Lou Reed, Edie Sedgwick and Kipp Stagg, and Freddy Last Dance —shown throughout the exhibition, the show allows for an intimate view of the artist's life and work.
Andy Warhol: Photo Factory is the largest West Coast exhibition of Warhol photography to date, with many of the images kept in a private collection until now.
My initial works were classical photographs, but in time, thanks to my interest in Warhol's world, especially that of Interview Magazine, I began to look at the artist's body of film-based works.
The NeueHouse exhibition, created in partnership with Fotografiska, affords the viewers an encyclopedic overview of Warhol's photo-based works spanning four decades and six bodies of work.","Hobbies & Interests

“This silkscreen was given to me during some crazy years and I had completely forgotten I even owned it,” Cooper said during a press conference last month.The piece has an estimated value of $2.5 million to $4.5 million and could become the most expensive painting ever sold in Arizona, according to the Larsen Gallery.
“I went through the garage and went through all these tubes and pulled it out, and it was in perfect condition,” Cooper said.Cooper said he’s selling it because although he collects art, mainly from local artists, he doesn’t collect Warhol.

Displaying more than 120 images (20 of those are being shown for the first time ever), it acts as a kind of visual narrative, explicating his short but epochal time as a living, working artist in a still culturally mercurial, nay electric period in New York City.
The latter’s Grace Noh explains, “Andy Warhol: Photo Factory was created to underscore who he was as a person, an artist and an experimenter through his photography, and to delve into the stories and subjects behind the surface of his iconic images – beyond those instant moments.”
Astutely, it’s divided into six categories: Polaroids of Celebrities, including the likes of Deborah Harry, Grace Jones and Keith Haring; Unique Gelatin Silver Prints, which were of more quotidian everyday objects; his amusingly memorable Photo Booth Strips taken in Times Square in the 1960s; 16mm Film Screen Tests, also from the ’60s, one of which was of tragic “it girl” Edie Sedgwick; Polaroid Collages made for publications like Vogue Paris and the now defunct Italian style mag Mondo Uomo; and ten of his his rarely seen, later period stitched photographs, which were first exhibited at New York’s Robert Miller Gallery in 1987, shortly before his untimely death.
Andy Warhol: Photo Factory will be on view at Neuehouse Hollywood through July 9, and will travel to Fotografiska New York this fall, and then on to Fotografiska Stockholm and Tallinn in 2022 and 2023, respectively.","Hobbies & Interests

Falco, a singer/songwriter, will play sets from ""The Will of the Way,"" his first solo album since 2007 that is due out on July 16, exclusively on Americana Vibes.
Falco has had a number of the album's songs for a while, but much of it was written during what he refers to as ""the great pause"" of 2020, according to a news release.
The concert comes on the heels of the release of the album's first single, ""Stones Unturned,"" which is ""a reflection of not being a little kid anymore,"" learning from lessons regardless of your age, and acknowledging ""that you don't have to have all the answers,"" according to Falco.
\ ""Being grounded from the road due to the pandemic, I've uncovered time to truly dive into songwriting in a way I never had before,"" Falco said, adding, that it was a very emotional time and and it led him to ponder ""a lot of questions internally like, ""Why am I writing this song?","Music

The foundation is committed to supporting organizations that amplify the voices of artists and position them at the center of critical conversations shaping our future.”
Sixteen of the fifty recipients are first-time grantees, and several of these are smaller organizations working collaboratively with artists to incubate ambitious projects.Among them are Los Angeles Nomadic Division; Bozeman, Montana’s Mountain Time Arts; Tiger Strikes Asteroid, operating in five cities across the country; and the River Institute for Contemporary Art in New Orleans.Of the nineteen museums, university galleries, and other arts organizations receiving grants assisting them in mounting large-scale exhibitions, a number are responding to the spirited outcry against racial injustice that has arisen globally since the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police.
The Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University, will investigate the conceptual and aesthetic strategies artists have used to reckon with the anti-Black violence sanctioned by the US over the past century in “A Site of Struggle: Making Meaning of Anti-Black Violence in American Art and Visual Culture,” while at the Mississippi Museum of Art, fourteen artists will create work around the Great Migration of 1915–70, during which an estimated six million people fled racial terror in the South.In keeping with the foundation’s core mission of supplying assistance to underrecognized and emerging artists, several institutions received grants earmarked for solo exhibitions.
Among them are the Aldrich Museum, whose “Duane Slick: the Coyote Makes the Sunset Better” will be the first solo museum exhibition for the Meskwaki artist, and the Orange County Museum of Art, whose “Fred Eversley: Reflect Back (the World)” will highlight the important contributions the artist made to the history of art in California while further examining his role as one of the only artists of color in the Light & Space movement.The full list of spring 2021 grantees is below.Spring 2021 Grant Recipients | Program Support Over 2 Years:Art21, New York, $100,000Season 11 of “Art in the

This exhibition, which will remain at the Museum until Sunday, October 3, is the first to be organised since March 2020.
The mayor has highlighted the importance of this day for the cultural Nerja.
“That these types of exhibitions are in our Museum is excellent news, from the point of view of culture, but also in its tourism aspect, since it complements the offer of the municipality, thus contributing to the reactivation of tourism.”
In addition, he has shown his conviction that there will be many residents and visitors who will come to the Museum of Nerja these months to enjoy the exhibition.During the visit to the exhibition, which has been guided by the director of the Museum of Glass and Crystal of Malaga and owner of the works, Gonzalo Fernández-Prieto, the Councillor for Culture and Education, Gema Laguna, has expressed her interest in working in a coordinated manner, together with the director of the Museum of Nerja, Juan Bautista Salado, to organise visits by schoolchildren from the municipality to the exhibition.Regarding the sample, it brings together 51 pieces, among which two by Andy Warhol and one by Salvador Dalí stand out, as well as by Harvey Littleton, Erwin Eisch, Samuel Herman and Sybren Walkema, maximum exponents of the Studio Glass movement, which was born in the 60s in the United States and later expanded throughout Europe.The works belong to the collection of the Glass and Crystal Museum of Malaga, they have been temporarily loaned to the Museum of Nerja, many of them never before exhibited in public.Thank you for reading, and don’t forget to check The Euro Weekly News for all your up-to-date local and international news stories.","Local News
